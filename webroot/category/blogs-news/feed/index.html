<p>This dataset shows all areas of Australia affected by the 2019-2020 bushfires. You can use this data in the ALA to&nbsp;search for&nbsp;species that may have been affected by the 2019-20 bushfires, by mapping occurrence records that have been logged in those areas, both before and after the fires.</p>



<p><strong>How to use the bushfire extent data in the ALA</strong></p>



<p>For more information on how to use this data in the ALA, read our help article <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000241564-using-the-national-indicative-aggregated-fire-extent-dataset-2019-20-in-the-ala" target="_blank">Using the National Indicative Aggregated Fire Extent Dataset 2019-20 in the ALA</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The National Indicative Aggregated Fire Extent Dataset</strong></p>



<p>The National Indicative Aggregated Fire Extent Dataset was developed by the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE) to help quantify the potential impacts of the 2019/20 bushfires on wildlife, plants and ecological communities, and identify appropriate response and recovery actions.</p>



<p>The dataset is a reliable, agreed, fit-for-purpose and repeatable national dataset of burnt areas across Australia for the 2019/20 bushfire season.</p>



<p><br>The National Indicative Aggregated Fire Extent Dataset includes:</p>



<ul><li>data from the national Emergency Management Spatial Information Network Australia (<a href="https://www.emsina.org/">EMSINA</a>) data service, which is the official fire extent currently used by the Australian Government, and</li><li>supplementary data from other sources to form a cumulative national view of fire extent from 1 July 2019 to the 21 April 2020, these sources include NSW Rural Fire Service, Northern Australian Fire Information (NAFI), QLD Fire and Emergency Service, QLD Department of Environment and Science, SA Country Fire Service, SA Department for Environment and Water, Tasmanian Fire Service, TAS Department of Primary Industry, Parks, Water and Environment, VIC Department of Environment, Land, Water &amp; Planning, WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.</li></ul>



<p>The dataset is released on behalf of the Australian Government and endorsed by the National Burnt Area Dataset Working Group, convened by the <a href="https://www.bushfirerecovery.gov.au/">National Bushfire Recovery Agency</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today we release our Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) strategy has been shaped extensively by input from our national and international partners who contributed so actively to our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png" alt="Image of the cover for the ALA Strategy 2020-2025" class="wp-image-44115" width="232" height="328" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png 603w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image-213x300.png 213w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf">Download the Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As Australia’s national biodiversity data infrastructure and one of the world’s foremost such capabilities, we rely on the strength of our partnerships with data providers, users and stakeholders. Indeed, the genesis of the ALA was built on the strength and richness of existing relationships within the museums, collections and herbaria communities. </p>



<p>Australia’s fruitful partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>) also provides our community a unique opportunity to ensure that local, regional or national biodiversity data delivers impact globally. The ALA is particularly proud of the relationship we play hosting the Australian node of GBIF.</p>



<p>Supported by the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (<a href="https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris">NCRIS</a>), and hosted by <a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>, the ALA website launched 10 years ago. Since those beginnings the ALA has matured from an energetic ‘start-up’ to a stable and reliable data infrastructure delivering world-trusted biodiversity data and related services.</p>



<p>Our strategy builds on this history while identifying where we need to evolve. This includes adapting our infrastructure to deal with an increase in volume and variety of data, improving how we deal with data quality in a federated system, delivering more comprehensive and representative national data holdings, and partnering with new sectors.</p>



<p>We welcome&nbsp;further conversations with our partners to identify&nbsp;possible alignment opportunities framed around our strategy.</p>



<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a> if you would like more information or if you have any questions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the winter edition of our ALA newsletter. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear ALA community,</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44152" width="162" height="162" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px" /></figure></div>



<p>We lead off this issue with the release of the ALA Strategy 2020-2025 which has been developed in response to the findings from our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process. Our communities’ feedback regarding what’s worked well and where the ALA needs to head to continue to remain relevant was instrumental in shaping the strategy and we are grateful for those contributions. Our strategy has also been informed by what our team understands needs to evolve to future-proof the ALA, for example with regard to the anticipated increase in the variety and volume of data we receive annually from our partners.</p>



<p>In response to our strategy we’ve already commenced both an architectural upgrade to our infrastructure, and the ALA data quality project both of which are described in further detail on our <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/current-projects/">projects pages</a>. These projects go to the core of our first two strategic objectives around delivering <em>trusted data</em> and provision of <em>robust services</em>. In addition to steering the ALA&#8217;s work program we see the strategy as an opportunity for our partners to identify points of engagement or alignment, and in coming months we’ll provide you greater clarity around our project roadmap.</p>



<p>In response to the summer bushfire crisis, ALA on behalf of CSIRO led a national coordination process bringing together the citizen science and research sectors to explore how best to support ongoing response and preparedness activities.&nbsp; This activity resulted in the publication of a <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Environment/Extreme-Events/Bushfire/Citizen-Science/Citizen-Science-Bushfire-Forums">recommendations report</a> which explores how to establish a national approach for ongoing citizen science and traditional science engagement. CSIRO have now appointed a program lead to further progress this work. Erin Roger, based with the ALA, will design and lead a program of work to engender greater coordination between both sectors with the aim of&nbsp; better supporting current recovery, and future preparedness activities as we approach the coming summer. We are pleased to be working so closely with CSIRO’s bushfire and recovery program.</p>



<p>And finally, in this issue we showcase three contemporary Australian research publications that leverage the capability of the ALA to further our understanding of climate impacts on eucalypts and coral, the long-term shifts in the distribution of plant species that provide critical habitat for Koalas, and evaluating low-cost techniques for monitoring pollinators in open and wooded habitats. For our data partners and our team its always rewarding to see how our collective efforts enable such important science.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy the winter edition of our newsletter.</p>



<p>Kind regards,</p>



<p>Andre Zerger</p>

<h3 id="spatial-information-in-the-ala"><strong>Spatial information in the ALA</strong></h3>



<p>Spatial information is a big part of what we do at the ALA. To enable thorough spatial analysis for our users, we sample each and every occurrence record from our data providers against several hundred spatial layers. This means that when you’re searching for species in the ALA, you can search by a particular area (for example, by the state of Victoria, or by a national park – we call these&nbsp;<em>contextual spatial layers</em>) or by a particular&nbsp;<em>environmental</em>&nbsp;condition, like climate, or vegetative cover. All layers can be visualised through our Spatial Portal, and some of them through our regions tool (<a href="https://regions.ala.org.au/">http://regions.ala.org.au/</a>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png" alt="Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers page in the ALA." class="wp-image-44146" width="538" height="369" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png 734w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers web page in the ALA.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="time-for-an-update"><strong>Time for an update</strong></h3>



<p>To ensure we continue to provide a national representative collection of environmental and contextual layers for analysis, we will be undertaking a review, update and consolidation of spatial layers that are provided within ALA services. This review will take into consideration:</p>



<h4 id="how-often-layers-are-used">How often layers are used</h4>



<p>We’ve found that many layers are not used very often at all in the Spatial Portal. Our stats tell us there’s a long-tail distribution of usage whereby 80% of layers are used less than 5% of the layer of maximum usage, and 40% are used less than 1% of the layer of maximum usage.</p>



<h4 id="our-system-performance">Our system performance</h4>



<p>Supporting and maintaining digital infrastructure to index and query hundreds of layers is particularly challenging and impose significant resource constraints.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-still-current-and-relevant">Whether layers are still current and relevant</h4>



<p>Some layers or suites of layers have been superseded, upgraded or are highly correlated with other layers.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-available-elsewhere">Whether layers are available elsewhere</h4>



<p>We needed to examine the ALA’s position in light of other related portals, such as the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (<a href="https://bccvl.org.au/">BCCVL</a>). The BCCVL is better suited to provide the multitude of climate model projections, and IMOS’ Australian Ocean Data Network portal (<a href="https://portal.aodn.org.au/">AODN</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://imos.org.au/">IMOS</a>) is better suited to provide oceanographic layers.</p>



<p>Our challenge is to provide a good representative sample of both environmental and contextual layers relevant to biodiversity data analysis, but we want to avoid being overly specialised.</p>



<h3 id="whats-next"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>



<p>Over the coming months we’ll be working on updating and rationalising our layer holdings. This review will be repeated annually. </p>



<h3 id="more-information"><strong>More information</strong></h3>



<p>More comprehensive information and technical detail about this process is provided in our Knowledge Base article ALA&nbsp;<a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000237045-what-are-environmental-and-contextual-spatial-layers-">Environmental and Contextual Spatial Layers</a>, including our criteria for review.</p>

<p>The ALA Data Quality project team is working hard to complete and release its first piece of software. But there&#8217;s still time to test and provide feedback.</p>



<p>Since the Data Quality Project launched in February, the team has been working with the ALA user community to identify data quality issues and develop solutions.  Thank you to everyone who has completed our surveys, contributed to baseline perceptions of data quality, helped to prioritise issues, or tested solutions so far. </p>



<p><strong> First proposed software release – improvements to data filters</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to issues identified in our data quality survey (see below), the project team are developing a new capability to pre-filter search results. This means lower quality records will not be shown unless they are actively included. </p>



<p>The new software will enable users to switch filters&nbsp;on&nbsp;or&nbsp;off&nbsp;and manage&nbsp;them&nbsp;as a group or&nbsp;individually. Information&nbsp;is available on the&nbsp;fields and data that make up the filters&nbsp;through mouse-over text and&nbsp;clickable info icons (i).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are still testing the new software and welcome your feedback. </p>



<h4 id="how-to-test-the-software">How to test the software</h4>



<ol><li>Sign in to our ALA <a href="https://biocache-dq-test.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=*%3A*">Test Environment</a>. </li><li>View the filters in the new user interface (UI) element above the search results. </li><li>Interact with the filters, noting how they work for you.</li><li>Email any comments or feedback to <a href="mailto:dataquality@ala.org.au">dataquality@ala.org.au</a>.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="471" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-1024x471.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44128" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-1024x471.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-300x138.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-768x353.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-1536x706.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1.png 1870w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Screenshot showing results from an occurrence records search. The proposed Data Quality Filters are circled in red.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Priori</strong><strong>ti</strong><strong>sation survey</strong><strong>&nbsp;results</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>After establishing a baseline for perceptions of data quality (<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/data-quality-project-baseline-survey-results/">see results</a>), we conducted a prioritisation survey. This helped to identify which issues the data quality project should address first. The top two issues identified were: </p>



<ul><li>ALA users are using data accessed via the ALA without filtering out records that are not fit for purpose. </li><li>Due to data quality indicators not being present, users are often unsure whether to use particular records or datasets. </li></ul>



<p>For more information on the&nbsp;data quality project please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/data-quality-project/">Data Quality&nbsp;project page</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataquality@ala.org.au">dataquality@ala.org.au</a>.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After the devastating bushfires at the start of the year, South Australian researchers took action. They tracked the remaining population of animals to understand how the fires had impacted them. They also looked at how the native species and landscape were recovering in the fire aftermath.]]></description>

<p><em>This article was written by Alex Horvat and first appeared in <a href="https://blog.csiro.au/">CSIROscope</a>.</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="567" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/Before-and-after-bushfires-Flinders-Chase-National-Park.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44091" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/Before-and-after-bushfires-Flinders-Chase-National-Park.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/Before-and-after-bushfires-Flinders-Chase-National-Park-300x221.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>Before and after pictures of the road through Flinders Chase National Park reveal the effects of the bushfires.

<h2 id="caught-on-camera">Caught on camera</h2>



<p>To do this, they launched their project on the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.csiro.au/citizen-science-bushfire-recovery/">Citizen Science Bushfire Project Finder</a>. The website let’s anyone anywhere in the world to play a part in Australia’s bushfire recovery.</p>



<p>A team from the South Australia Department for Environment and Water got to work. They set up over 70 cameras across Kangaroo Island. With these cameras they wanted to capture the remaining species on tape. But this was only the first step.</p>



<p>The team uploaded over 15,000 images captured by these cameras to a virtual expedition. This expedition allows volunteers to help review each image.</p>



<p>“The process of reviewing each photo takes time,” National Parks and Wildlife Service South Australia Conversation and Wildlife Manager Jason Higham said.</p>



<p>“By using the curiosity, expertise and willingness to help that is present in the community, the field team can focus their efforts on feral cat control measures and searching remnant patches for wildlife such as for the Kangaroo Island dunnart.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="954" height="629" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44092" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart.jpg 954w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart-768x506.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /><figcaption>The Kangaroo Island dunnart. Only found on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. Image credit: Government of South Australia Department for Environment and Water.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="the-kangaroo-island-dunnart-expedition">The Kangaroo Island dunnart expedition</h2>



<p>The Kangaroo Island dunnart is only found on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. It’s critically endangered with a population estimated at 300-500 individuals. This estimate was before the 2019-20 bushfires.</p>



<p>More than 90 per cent of the dunnarts’ habitat was burnt in the bushfires. Therefore there’s been a significant decline in the population. This means it’s more important than ever to track and protect these animals.</p>



<p>In April, we launched the virtual expeditions and Kangaroo Island Dunnart Survey project as part of our Citizen Science Bushfire Project. And with great success.</p>



<p>Volunteers from across Australia joined the expeditions. They reviewed a series of images and a list of possible animals to look out for. Keen-eyes worked out what species were in the images. And once submitted, the team sent the next set of images. Addictive, right?</p>



<p>Within three weeks of launching, the volunteers identified and classified 15,000 images for the dunnart survey. The team were overwhelmed with eager people asking when there would be more images to transcribe.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44093" width="911" height="683" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart-640x480.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 911px) 100vw, 911px" /><figcaption>Volunteers identified the species found in images like this one taken by motion sensing cameras. Image credit: Government of South Australia Department for Environment and Water.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="where-to-now">Where to now?</h2>



<p>With the images classified, the information went to the researchers for analysis. They are incredibly grateful for all the hard work.</p>



<p>Your contribution means the team can focus their time and effort elsewhere. Like controlling predators and searching for the remaining species populations.</p>



<p>The data gathered from the images will:</p>



<ul><li>Help to develop an in-depth understanding of the surviving animal populations. This will inform research into how the native species react to and recover from bushfire conditions.</li><li>Assist with feral predator control. This ensures the remaining animal population is safe from predators when they’re most at risk.</li><li>Generate recovery actions for species like the Kangaroo Island dunnart, little pygmy possum and southern brown bandicoot. As a result of the bushfires, species may be at risk of low population numbers. It’s up to the researchers to come up with a plan to make sure the species can continue to thrive on the island.</li></ul>



<h2 id="want-to-help">Want to help?</h2>



<p>Do you live in a bushfire affected area? There are lots of ways to contribute species sightings, help track the recovery of plant species and more.</p>



<p>There are also a variety of projects you can jump into from the comfort of your own home. To get involved, visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/bushfire_recovery">Citizen Science Bushfire Project Finder</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Two of Australia’s most iconic ecosystems, eucalypt trees and reef corals, could end up being the ‘best of pals’ when it comes to fighting climate change.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br><em>This story was written by Amy Edwards and first appeared in <a href="https://ecos.csiro.au/">ECOS,</a> CSIRO&#8217;s environmental and sustainability science news.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44072" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Burnt Eucalypts regenerating on Putty Road, NSW near the Hunter Valley following the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season.

<p>On the surface marine animals such as reef corals and plant species like eucalypts sound very different.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Sure they are both iconic Australian species but could they really end up being best mates in the fight against climate change?</p>



<p>“You betcha,” according to native forest specialist Dr Trevor Booth from CSIRO and coral researcher Dr Paul Muir from the Museum of Tropical Queensland.</p>



<p>The scientists have teamed up to highlight these important Australian ecosystems and their similarities in biology and vulnerability to rapid climate change.</p>



<p>Their paper&nbsp;<em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.657">Climate change impacts on Australia’s eucalypt and coral species: Comparing and sharing knowledge across disciplines</a></em>&nbsp;has been published in the online journal WIREs Climate Change.</p>



<h2 id="same-same-but-different">Same, same but different</h2>



<p>There are many similarities in the biology of eucalypts and corals. They are both long-lived, unmoving organisms that can reproduce asexually, but also sexually by broadcasting very large quantities of tiny offspring. Corals are the most plant-like of all animals, deriving much of their energy from photosynthesis via microscopic algae that live symbiotically within their tissues. But perhaps most importantly, eucalypts and reef corals are the key foundation species in their respective ecosystems, providing much of the framework that hundreds of thousands of other species rely upon.</p>



<p>“Losing these key foundation species would be catastrophic for many of our most diverse ecosystems,” Booth said.</p>

<p>Eucalyptus trees and reef corals are on the front line of many climate change impacts. Just in the past six months, eucalypts have suffered heavy losses from the catastrophic 2019-2020 Australian bushfires linked to extreme climate events. Corals have suffered mortalities from moderate to severe&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/news-room/latest-news/latest-news/coral-bleaching/2020/statement-coral-bleaching-on-the-great-barrier-reef">coral bleaching</a>&nbsp;associated with unusually high seawater temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef.</p>



<p>“By comparing research efforts, eucalypt and reef coral workers might benefit from each other’s experiences,” Muir said.</p>



<p>“Researchers are putting huge efforts into understanding these threats, likely future changes and how we can manage these systems to prevent species extinctions.”</p>



<p>One example where knowledge could be usefully shared is in the prediction of changes to species distributions that will occur from climate change impacts.</p>



<h2 id="how-are-a-plant-and-animal-species-going-to-help-each-other-to-fight-climate-change">How are a plant and animal species going to help each other to fight climate change?</h2>



<p>CSIRO researchers made pioneering advances in developing species distribution modelling or&nbsp;<a href="https://csiropedia.csiro.au/bioclim/">SDM</a>, which determines how environmental factors such as mean annual temperature and rainfall of the driest quarter shape a species distribution. More recently, eucalypt researchers from various agencies have predicted likely future changes in species distribution under various climate change scenarios. These results are critical for managing ecosystems, for example by identifying particularly vulnerable species and tailoring management responses to prevent species declines. Researchers have spent many years working collaboratively with other colleagues and institutions developing the large datasets of species distributions and environmental conditions that are required for SDM analyses. In contrast, SDM analyses have only rarely been used in coral research but could provide important information for managing the future of reefs.</p>



<p>“I am hoping the work we have done with eucalypts can help coral researchers benefit from these methods and avoid some of the traps,” Booth said.</p>



<p>Four key areas of research Booth and Muir considered in the journal article were:</p>



<p>(1) modelling current distributions,</p>



<p>(2) assessing impacts of climate change on future distributions,</p>



<p>(3) using human-assisted migration to improve survival and</p>



<p>(4) applying genetic enhancement to improve species’ survival.</p>



<p>With many years of examining the climatic tolerances of eucalypts, it is not surprising that experience from eucalypt studies may have more to offer climate change studies of corals than vice versa. However coral studies are successfully and rapidly applying novel spatial, controlled environment and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.csiro.au/heat-resistant-coral/">genomic methods</a>&nbsp;to assess how coral species may adapt to changing climatic conditions.</p>

<p>For their research, the authors extensively used the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a>&nbsp;that provides an online repository for both terrestrial and marine data along with a suite of tools to analyse these data.</p>



<p>“The marine section of the data base is not used as much as it could be so it would be great if our journal article prompts more coral researchers and community members to use it and enhance existing datasets of coral species distribution and environmental conditions,” Booth said.</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia also supports and integrates the extensive national citizen science community into its data system.</p>



<h2 id="two-unlikely-fellows">Two unlikely fellows</h2>



<p>Booth and Muir, and the partnership they formed for their research, was almost as unlikely as their subject matter.</p>



<p>“I was listening to the ABC ‘Science Show’ in February 2019 and they had a program on coral spawning and assisted evolution work taking place at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in Townsville,” Booth said.</p>



<p>“I thought to myself ‘that’s an awful lot like the work we are doing with eucalypts’ and that prompted this exchange of ideas<strong>.”</strong></p>



<p>Booth got in touch with a contact at AIMS who introduced him to Muir at the Museum and the collaboration began. All three organisations contributed to some early discussions relevant to the final journal paper.</p>



<p>“At first I thought it was a bit of a strange idea, but I soon realised the potential of the research. And I do take an interest in trees as I live on a large property,” Muir said.</p>



<p>“I’m very fortunate Paul was willing to continue,” Booth joked.</p>



<p>However the partnership came about, both scientists agree “there’s a lot to be learnt from looking outside the box of one’s own research area”.</p>
