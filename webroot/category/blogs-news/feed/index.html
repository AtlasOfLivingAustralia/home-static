					<description><![CDATA[Today we release our Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) strategy has been shaped extensively by input from our national and international partners who contributed so actively to our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png" alt="Image of the cover for the ALA Strategy 2020-2025" class="wp-image-44115" width="232" height="328" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png 603w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image-213x300.png 213w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf">Download the Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As Australia’s national biodiversity data infrastructure and one of the world’s foremost such capabilities, we rely on the strength of our partnerships with data providers, users and stakeholders. Indeed, the genesis of the ALA was built on the strength and richness of existing relationships within the museums, collections and herbaria communities. </p>



<p>Australia’s fruitful partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>) also provides our community a unique opportunity to ensure that local, regional or national biodiversity data delivers impact globally. The ALA is particularly proud of the relationship we play hosting the Australian node of GBIF.</p>



<p>Supported by the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (<a href="https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris">NCRIS</a>), and hosted by <a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>, the ALA website launched 10 years ago. Since those beginnings the ALA has matured from an energetic ‘start-up’ to a stable and reliable data infrastructure delivering world-trusted biodiversity data and related services.</p>



<p>Our strategy builds on this history while identifying where we need to evolve. This includes adapting our infrastructure to deal with an increase in volume and variety of data, improving how we deal with data quality in a federated system, delivering more comprehensive and representative national data holdings, and partnering with new sectors.</p>



<p>We welcome&nbsp;further conversations with our partners to identify&nbsp;possible alignment opportunities framed around our strategy.</p>



<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a> if you would like more information or if you have any questions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the winter edition of our ALA newsletter. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear ALA community,</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44152" width="162" height="162" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px" /></figure></div>



<p>We lead off this issue with the release of the ALA Strategy 2020-2025 which has been developed in response to the findings from our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process. Our communities’ feedback regarding what’s worked well and where the ALA needs to head to continue to remain relevant was instrumental in shaping the strategy and we are grateful for those contributions. Our strategy has also been informed by what our team understands needs to evolve to future-proof the ALA, for example with regard to the anticipated increase in the variety and volume of data we receive annually from our partners.</p>



<p>In response to our strategy we’ve already commenced both an architectural upgrade to our infrastructure, and the ALA data quality project both of which are described in further detail on our <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/current-projects/">projects pages</a>. These projects go to the core of our first two strategic objectives around delivering <em>trusted data</em> and provision of <em>robust services</em>. In addition to steering the ALA&#8217;s work program we see the strategy as an opportunity for our partners to identify points of engagement or alignment, and in coming months we’ll provide you greater clarity around our project roadmap.</p>



<p>In response to the summer bushfire crisis, ALA on behalf of CSIRO led a national coordination process bringing together the citizen science and research sectors to explore how best to support ongoing response and preparedness activities.&nbsp; This activity resulted in the publication of a <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Environment/Extreme-Events/Bushfire/Citizen-Science/Citizen-Science-Bushfire-Forums">recommendations report</a> which explores how to establish a national approach for ongoing citizen science and traditional science engagement. CSIRO have now appointed a program lead to further progress this work. Erin Roger, based with the ALA, will design and lead a program of work to engender greater coordination between both sectors with the aim of&nbsp; better supporting current recovery, and future preparedness activities as we approach the coming summer. We are pleased to be working so closely with CSIRO’s bushfire and recovery program.</p>



<p>And finally, in this issue we showcase three contemporary Australian research publications that leverage the capability of the ALA to further our understanding of climate impacts on eucalypts and coral, the long-term shifts in the distribution of plant species that provide critical habitat for Koalas, and evaluating low-cost techniques for monitoring pollinators in open and wooded habitats. For our data partners and our team its always rewarding to see how our collective efforts enable such important science.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy the winter edition of our newsletter.</p>



<p>Kind regards,</p>



<p>Andre Zerger</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’re starting a review of our environmental and contextual layers to improve user experience and system performance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44145" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png 305w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1-300x255.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></figure></div>



<h3 id="spatial-information-in-the-ala"><strong>Spatial information in the ALA</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://regions.ala.org.au/">https://regions.ala.org.au/https://regions.ala.org.au/</a>Spatial information is a big part of what we do at the ALA. To enable thorough spatial analysis for our users, we sample each and every occurrence record from our data providers against several hundred spatial layers. This means that when you’re searching for species in the ALA, you can search by a particular area (for example, by the state of Victoria, or by a national park – we call these <em>contextual spatial layers</em>) or by a particular <em>environmental</em> condition, like climate, or vegetative cover. All layers can be visualised through our Spatial Portal, and some of them through our regions tool (<a href="https://regions.ala.org.au/">http://regions.ala.org.au/</a>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png" alt="Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers page in the ALA." class="wp-image-44146" width="538" height="369" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png 734w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers web page in the ALA.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="time-for-an-update"><strong>Time for an update</strong></h3>



<p>To ensure we continue to provide a national representative collection of environmental and contextual layers for analysis, we will be undertaking a review, update and consolidation of spatial layers that are provided within ALA services. This review will take into consideration:</p>



<h4 id="how-often-layers-are-used">How often layers are used</h4>



<p>We’ve found that many layers are not used very often at all. Our stats tell us there’s a long-tail distribution of usage whereby 80% of layers are used less than 5% of the layer of maximum usage, and 40% are used less than 1% of the layer of maximum usage.</p>



<h4 id="our-system-performance">Our system performance</h4>



<p>Supporting and maintaining digital infrastructure to index and query hundreds of layers is particularly challenging and impose significant resource constraints.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-still-current-and-relevant">Whether layers are still current and relevant</h4>



<p>Some layers or suites of layers have been superseded, upgraded or are highly correlated with other layers.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-available-elsewhere">Whether layers are available elsewhere</h4>



<p>We needed to examine the ALA’s position in light of other related portals, such as the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (<a href="https://bccvl.org.au/">BCCVL</a>). The BCCVL is better suited to provide the multitude of climate model projections, and IMOS’ Australian Ocean Data Network portal (<a href="https://portal.aodn.org.au/">AODN</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://imos.org.au/">IMOS</a>) is better suited to provide oceanographic layers.</p>



<p>Our challenge is to provide a good representative sample of both environmental and contextual layers relevant to biodiversity data analysis, but we want to avoid being overly specialised.</p>



<h3 id="whats-next"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>



<p>Over the coming months we’ll be working on updating and rationalising our layer holdings. This review will be repeated annually. </p>



<h3 id="more-information"><strong>More information</strong></h3>



<p>More comprehensive information and technical detail about this process is provided in our Knowledge Base article ALA&nbsp;<a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000237045-what-are-environmental-and-contextual-spatial-layers-">Environmental and Contextual Spatial Layers</a>, including our criteria for review.</p>



<p>As usual, if you have any questions or comments, please let us know at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a>.</p>

<p>The ALA Data Quality project team is working hard to complete and release its first piece of software. But there&#8217;s still time to test and provide feedback.</p>



<p>Since the Data Quality Project launched in February, the team has been working with the ALA user community to identify data quality issues and develop solutions.  Thank you to everyone who has completed our surveys, contributed to baseline perceptions of data quality, helped to prioritise issues, or tested solutions so far. </p>



<p><strong> First proposed software release – improvements to data filters</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to issues identified in our data quality survey (see below), the project team are developing a new capability to pre-filter search results. This means lower quality records will not be shown unless they are actively included. </p>



<p>The new software will enable users to switch filters&nbsp;on&nbsp;or&nbsp;off&nbsp;and manage&nbsp;them&nbsp;as a group or&nbsp;individually. Information&nbsp;is available on the&nbsp;fields and data that make up the filters&nbsp;through mouse-over text and&nbsp;clickable info icons (i).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are still testing the new software and welcome your feedback. </p>



<h4 id="how-to-test-the-software">How to test the software</h4>



<ol><li>Sign in to our ALA <a href="https://biocache-dq-test.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=*%3A*">Test Environment</a>. </li><li>View the filters in the new user interface (UI) element above the search results. </li><li>Interact with the filters, noting how they work for you.</li><li>Email any comments or feedback to <a href="mailto:dataquality@ala.org.au">dataquality@ala.org.au</a>.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-1024x471.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44128" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-1024x471.png 1024w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-300x138.png 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-768x353.png 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-1536x706.png 1536w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1.png 1870w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Screenshot showing results from an occurrence records search. The proposed Data Quality Filters are circled in red.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Priori</strong><strong>ti</strong><strong>sation survey</strong><strong>&nbsp;results</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>After establishing a baseline for perceptions of data quality (<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/data-quality-project-baseline-survey-results/">see results</a>), we conducted a prioritisation survey. This helped to identify which issues the data quality project should address first. The top two issues identified were: </p>



<ul><li>ALA users are using data accessed via the ALA without filtering out records that are not fit for purpose. </li><li>Due to data quality indicators not being present, users are often unsure whether to use particular records or datasets. </li></ul>



<p>For more information on the&nbsp;data quality project please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/data-quality-project/">Data Quality&nbsp;project page</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataquality@ala.org.au">dataquality@ala.org.au</a>.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After the devastating bushfires at the start of the year, South Australian researchers took action. They tracked the remaining population of animals to understand how the fires had impacted them. They also looked at how the native species and landscape were recovering in the fire aftermath.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>This article was written by Alex Horvat and first appeared in <a href="https://blog.csiro.au/">CSIROscope</a>.</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/Before-and-after-bushfires-Flinders-Chase-National-Park.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44091" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/Before-and-after-bushfires-Flinders-Chase-National-Park.jpg 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/Before-and-after-bushfires-Flinders-Chase-National-Park-300x221.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>Before and after pictures of the road through Flinders Chase National Park reveal the effects of the bushfires.

<h2 id="caught-on-camera">Caught on camera</h2>



<p>To do this, they launched their project on the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.csiro.au/citizen-science-bushfire-recovery/">Citizen Science Bushfire Project Finder</a>. The website let’s anyone anywhere in the world to play a part in Australia’s bushfire recovery.</p>



<p>A team from the South Australia Department for Environment and Water got to work. They set up over 70 cameras across Kangaroo Island. With these cameras they wanted to capture the remaining species on tape. But this was only the first step.</p>



<p>The team uploaded over 15,000 images captured by these cameras to a virtual expedition. This expedition allows volunteers to help review each image.</p>



<p>“The process of reviewing each photo takes time,” National Parks and Wildlife Service South Australia Conversation and Wildlife Manager Jason Higham said.</p>



<p>“By using the curiosity, expertise and willingness to help that is present in the community, the field team can focus their efforts on feral cat control measures and searching remnant patches for wildlife such as for the Kangaroo Island dunnart.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44092" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart.jpg 954w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart-768x506.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /><figcaption>The Kangaroo Island dunnart. Only found on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. Image credit: Government of South Australia Department for Environment and Water.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="the-kangaroo-island-dunnart-expedition">The Kangaroo Island dunnart expedition</h2>



<p>The Kangaroo Island dunnart is only found on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. It’s critically endangered with a population estimated at 300-500 individuals. This estimate was before the 2019-20 bushfires.</p>



<p>More than 90 per cent of the dunnarts’ habitat was burnt in the bushfires. Therefore there’s been a significant decline in the population. This means it’s more important than ever to track and protect these animals.</p>



<p>In April, we launched the virtual expeditions and Kangaroo Island Dunnart Survey project as part of our Citizen Science Bushfire Project. And with great success.</p>



<p>Volunteers from across Australia joined the expeditions. They reviewed a series of images and a list of possible animals to look out for. Keen-eyes worked out what species were in the images. And once submitted, the team sent the next set of images. Addictive, right?</p>



<p>Within three weeks of launching, the volunteers identified and classified 15,000 images for the dunnart survey. The team were overwhelmed with eager people asking when there would be more images to transcribe.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44093" width="911" height="683" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart.jpg 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart-640x480.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 911px) 100vw, 911px" /><figcaption>Volunteers identified the species found in images like this one taken by motion sensing cameras. Image credit: Government of South Australia Department for Environment and Water.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="where-to-now">Where to now?</h2>



<p>With the images classified, the information went to the researchers for analysis. They are incredibly grateful for all the hard work.</p>



<p>Your contribution means the team can focus their time and effort elsewhere. Like controlling predators and searching for the remaining species populations.</p>



<p>The data gathered from the images will:</p>



<ul><li>Help to develop an in-depth understanding of the surviving animal populations. This will inform research into how the native species react to and recover from bushfire conditions.</li><li>Assist with feral predator control. This ensures the remaining animal population is safe from predators when they’re most at risk.</li><li>Generate recovery actions for species like the Kangaroo Island dunnart, little pygmy possum and southern brown bandicoot. As a result of the bushfires, species may be at risk of low population numbers. It’s up to the researchers to come up with a plan to make sure the species can continue to thrive on the island.</li></ul>



<h2 id="want-to-help">Want to help?</h2>



<p>Do you live in a bushfire affected area? There are lots of ways to contribute species sightings, help track the recovery of plant species and more.</p>



<p>There are also a variety of projects you can jump into from the comfort of your own home. To get involved, visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/bushfire_recovery">Citizen Science Bushfire Project Finder</a>.</p>



<p><em>The&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.csiro.au/citizen-science-bushfire-recovery/">Citizen Science Bushfire Project Finder website</a>&nbsp;is a collaboration between CSIRO, the Atlas of Living Australia and the Australian Citizen Science Association.</em></p>

<p>On the surface marine animals such as reef corals and plant species like eucalypts sound very different.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Sure they are both iconic Australian species but could they really end up being best mates in the fight against climate change?</p>



<p>“You betcha,” according to native forest specialist Dr Trevor Booth from CSIRO and coral researcher Dr Paul Muir from the Museum of Tropical Queensland.</p>



<p>The scientists have teamed up to highlight these important Australian ecosystems and their similarities in biology and vulnerability to rapid climate change.</p>



<p>Their paper&nbsp;<em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.657">Climate change impacts on Australia’s eucalypt and coral species: Comparing and sharing knowledge across disciplines</a></em>&nbsp;has been published in the online journal WIREs Climate Change.</p>



<h2 id="same-same-but-different">Same, same but different</h2>



<p>There are many similarities in the biology of eucalypts and corals. They are both long-lived, unmoving organisms that can reproduce asexually, but also sexually by broadcasting very large quantities of tiny offspring. Corals are the most plant-like of all animals, deriving much of their energy from photosynthesis via microscopic algae that live symbiotically within their tissues. But perhaps most importantly, eucalypts and reef corals are the key foundation species in their respective ecosystems, providing much of the framework that hundreds of thousands of other species rely upon.</p>



<p>“Losing these key foundation species would be catastrophic for many of our most diverse ecosystems,” Booth said.</p>



<p>“Coral is the more vulnerable of the two groups when it comes to climate change but both collections of species have been and will be significantly affected.”</p>

Image by Paul Muir.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Eucalyptus trees and reef corals are on the front line of many climate change impacts. Just in the past six months, eucalypts have suffered heavy losses from the catastrophic 2019-2020 Australian bushfires linked to extreme climate events. Corals have suffered mortalities from moderate to severe&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/news-room/latest-news/latest-news/coral-bleaching/2020/statement-coral-bleaching-on-the-great-barrier-reef">coral bleaching</a>&nbsp;associated with unusually high seawater temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef.</p>



<p>“By comparing research efforts, eucalypt and reef coral workers might benefit from each other’s experiences,” Muir said.</p>



<p>“Researchers are putting huge efforts into understanding these threats, likely future changes and how we can manage these systems to prevent species extinctions.”</p>



<p>One example where knowledge could be usefully shared is in the prediction of changes to species distributions that will occur from climate change impacts.</p>



<h2 id="how-are-a-plant-and-animal-species-going-to-help-each-other-to-fight-climate-change">How are a plant and animal species going to help each other to fight climate change?</h2>



<p>CSIRO researchers made pioneering advances in developing species distribution modelling or&nbsp;<a href="https://csiropedia.csiro.au/bioclim/">SDM</a>, which determines how environmental factors such as mean annual temperature and rainfall of the driest quarter shape a species distribution. More recently, eucalypt researchers from various agencies have predicted likely future changes in species distribution under various climate change scenarios. These results are critical for managing ecosystems, for example by identifying particularly vulnerable species and tailoring management responses to prevent species declines. Researchers have spent many years working collaboratively with other colleagues and institutions developing the large datasets of species distributions and environmental conditions that are required for SDM analyses. In contrast, SDM analyses have only rarely been used in coral research but could provide important information for managing the future of reefs.</p>



<p>“I am hoping the work we have done with eucalypts can help coral researchers benefit from these methods and avoid some of the traps,” Booth said.</p>



<p>Four key areas of research Booth and Muir considered in the journal article were:</p>



<p>(1) modelling current distributions,</p>



<p>(2) assessing impacts of climate change on future distributions,</p>



<p>(3) using human-assisted migration to improve survival and</p>



<p>(4) applying genetic enhancement to improve species’ survival.</p>



<p>With many years of examining the climatic tolerances of eucalypts, it is not surprising that experience from eucalypt studies may have more to offer climate change studies of corals than vice versa. However coral studies are successfully and rapidly applying novel spatial, controlled environment and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.csiro.au/heat-resistant-coral/">genomic methods</a>&nbsp;to assess how coral species may adapt to changing climatic conditions.</p>

<p>For their research, the authors extensively used the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a>&nbsp;that provides an online repository for both terrestrial and marine data along with a suite of tools to analyse these data.</p>



<p>“The marine section of the data base is not used as much as it could be so it would be great if our journal article prompts more coral researchers and community members to use it and enhance existing datasets of coral species distribution and environmental conditions,” Booth said.</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia also supports and integrates the extensive national citizen science community into its data system.</p>



<h2 id="two-unlikely-fellows">Two unlikely fellows</h2>



<p>Booth and Muir, and the partnership they formed for their research, was almost as unlikely as their subject matter.</p>



<p>“I was listening to the ABC ‘Science Show’ in February 2019 and they had a program on coral spawning and assisted evolution work taking place at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in Townsville,” Booth said.</p>



<p>“I thought to myself ‘that’s an awful lot like the work we are doing with eucalypts’ and that prompted this exchange of ideas<strong>.”</strong></p>



<p>Booth got in touch with a contact at AIMS who introduced him to Muir at the Museum and the collaboration began. All three organisations contributed to some early discussions relevant to the final journal paper.</p>



<p>“At first I thought it was a bit of a strange idea, but I soon realised the potential of the research. And I do take an interest in trees as I live on a large property,” Muir said.</p>



<p>“I’m very fortunate Paul was willing to continue,” Booth joked.</p>



<p>However the partnership came about, both scientists agree “there’s a lot to be learnt from looking outside the box of one’s own research area”.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://invasives.com.au/"> Centre for Invasive Species Solutions</a> has launched a beta version of <a href="https://weeds.org.au">Weeds Australia</a>, a new nationally focused weeds’ website providing best practice information on weeds management within Australia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The site was developed with the weeds’ community front of mind and as they continue to make updates throughout 2020, the project team are seeking your feedback on the site through an online feedback form which can be found on the right side of the site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The site currently houses information on 398 weeds management profiles, a useful identification tool, an extensive resource library and so much more. The management profiles are currently undergoing a review which is hoped to be finished in&nbsp;late 2020/early 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This new digital resource was developed through funding from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment.&nbsp;The project was led by the<a href="https://invasives.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Centre for Invasive Species Solutions</a>,&nbsp;and the ALA provided&nbsp;training&nbsp;and support&nbsp;as well as technical advice in the&nbsp;use of the&nbsp;profile management tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visit the <a href="https://weeds.org.au">Weeds Australia</a> beta site today and see what you think!</p>

<p>BHL Australia’s mission is to make Australia’s biodiversity literature freely accessible and discoverable. Ten years ago, we started with a single contributing organisation, Museums Victoria, and a team of five incredibly dedicated volunteers. Over the past 10 years, BHL Australia has grown. Our operation is still hosted by Museums Victoria (at the Melbourne Museum), but we now digitise literature (and ingest born-digital material) on behalf of 27 organisations across the country.</p>

Our volunteer team has also grown considerably since 2010; BHL Australia now has 15 amazing volunteers who do the majority of our scanning, cropping, image processing and metadata addition work, as well as 3 science communication volunteers. (You may have seen their hugely successful <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18087132769113004/?hl=en">takeover of the BHL Instagram account</a> during #BirdWeek last year.)</p>

<p>Of course, like so many other digitisation operations around the globe, BHL Australia is now in lockdown (and has been since mid-March). But out of adversity comes opportunity. While in lockdown, we’ve switched our focus from physical to born-digital material. We’ve welcomed new contributors and have uploaded journal volumes published as recently as late 2019. We’ve also started a major project (in collaboration with BHL superuser Rod Page) to upload article metadata for every Australian journal on BHL (we’re pretty obsessed with discoverability).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And, like so many others, we’ve also had to postpone our celebrations. We had planned to invite all our Australian contributors and volunteers to a big BHL birthday bash. That’s on hold for now, but in the meantime, here are our BHL staff &#8211; Cerise, Chris, Veronica and myself &#8211; waving our thanks to all those who support BHL Australia. To our volunteers, our contributors, the Atlas of Living Australia and our BHL community around the world &#8211; thank you for a wonderful 10 years!</p>
