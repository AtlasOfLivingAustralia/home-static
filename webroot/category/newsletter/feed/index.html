					<description><![CDATA[Today we release our Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) strategy has been shaped extensively by input from our national and international partners who contributed so actively to our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png" alt="Image of the cover for the ALA Strategy 2020-2025" class="wp-image-44115" width="232" height="328" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png 603w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image-213x300.png 213w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf">Download the Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As Australia’s national biodiversity data infrastructure and one of the world’s foremost such capabilities, we rely on the strength of our partnerships with data providers, users and stakeholders. Indeed, the genesis of the ALA was built on the strength and richness of existing relationships within the museums, collections and herbaria communities. </p>



<p>Australia’s fruitful partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>) also provides our community a unique opportunity to ensure that local, regional or national biodiversity data delivers impact globally. The ALA is particularly proud of the relationship we play hosting the Australian node of GBIF.</p>



<p>Supported by the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (<a href="https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris">NCRIS</a>), and hosted by <a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>, the ALA website launched 10 years ago. Since those beginnings the ALA has matured from an energetic ‘start-up’ to a stable and reliable data infrastructure delivering world-trusted biodiversity data and related services.</p>



<p>Our strategy builds on this history while identifying where we need to evolve. This includes adapting our infrastructure to deal with an increase in volume and variety of data, improving how we deal with data quality in a federated system, delivering more comprehensive and representative national data holdings, and partnering with new sectors.</p>



<p>We welcome&nbsp;further conversations with our partners to identify&nbsp;possible alignment opportunities framed around our strategy.</p>



<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a> if you would like more information or if you have any questions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the winter edition of our ALA newsletter. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear ALA community,</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44152" width="162" height="162" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px" /></figure></div>



<p>We lead off this issue with the release of the ALA Strategy 2020-2025 which has been developed in response to the findings from our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process. Our communities’ feedback regarding what’s worked well and where the ALA needs to head to continue to remain relevant was instrumental in shaping the strategy and we are grateful for those contributions. Our strategy has also been informed by what our team understands needs to evolve to future-proof the ALA, for example with regard to the anticipated increase in the variety and volume of data we receive annually from our partners.</p>



<p>In response to our strategy we’ve already commenced both an architectural upgrade to our infrastructure, and the ALA data quality project both of which are described in further detail on our <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/current-projects/">projects pages</a>. These projects go to the core of our first two strategic objectives around delivering <em>trusted data</em> and provision of <em>robust services</em>. In addition to steering the ALA&#8217;s work program we see the strategy as an opportunity for our partners to identify points of engagement or alignment, and in coming months we’ll provide you greater clarity around our project roadmap.</p>



<p>In response to the summer bushfire crisis, ALA on behalf of CSIRO led a national coordination process bringing together the citizen science and research sectors to explore how best to support ongoing response and preparedness activities.&nbsp; This activity resulted in the publication of a <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Environment/Extreme-Events/Bushfire/Citizen-Science/Citizen-Science-Bushfire-Forums">recommendations report</a> which explores how to establish a national approach for ongoing citizen science and traditional science engagement. CSIRO have now appointed a program lead to further progress this work. Erin Roger, based with the ALA, will design and lead a program of work to engender greater coordination between both sectors with the aim of&nbsp; better supporting current recovery, and future preparedness activities as we approach the coming summer. We are pleased to be working so closely with CSIRO’s bushfire and recovery program.</p>



<p>And finally, in this issue we showcase three contemporary Australian research publications that leverage the capability of the ALA to further our understanding of climate impacts on eucalypts and coral, the long-term shifts in the distribution of plant species that provide critical habitat for Koalas, and evaluating low-cost techniques for monitoring pollinators in open and wooded habitats. For our data partners and our team its always rewarding to see how our collective efforts enable such important science.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy the winter edition of our newsletter.</p>



<p>Kind regards,</p>



<p>Andre Zerger</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’re starting a review of our environmental and contextual layers to improve user experience and system performance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="305" height="259" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44145" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png 305w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1-300x255.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></figure></div>



<h3 id="spatial-information-in-the-ala"><strong>Spatial information in the ALA</strong></h3>



<p>Spatial information is a big part of what we do at the ALA. To enable thorough spatial analysis for our users, we sample each and every occurrence record from our data providers against several hundred spatial layers. This means that when you’re searching for species in the ALA, you can search by a particular area (for example, by the state of Victoria, or by a national park – we call these&nbsp;<em>contextual spatial layers</em>) or by a particular&nbsp;<em>environmental</em>&nbsp;condition, like climate, or vegetative cover. All layers can be visualised through our Spatial Portal, and some of them through our regions tool (<a href="https://regions.ala.org.au/">http://regions.ala.org.au/</a>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png" alt="Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers page in the ALA." class="wp-image-44146" width="538" height="369" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png 734w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers web page in the ALA.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="time-for-an-update"><strong>Time for an update</strong></h3>



<p>To ensure we continue to provide a national representative collection of environmental and contextual layers for analysis, we will be undertaking a review, update and consolidation of spatial layers that are provided within ALA services. This review will take into consideration:</p>



<h4 id="how-often-layers-are-used">How often layers are used</h4>



<p>We’ve found that many layers are not used very often at all in the Spatial Portal. Our stats tell us there’s a long-tail distribution of usage whereby 80% of layers are used less than 5% of the layer of maximum usage, and 40% are used less than 1% of the layer of maximum usage.</p>



<h4 id="our-system-performance">Our system performance</h4>



<p>Supporting and maintaining digital infrastructure to index and query hundreds of layers is particularly challenging and impose significant resource constraints.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-still-current-and-relevant">Whether layers are still current and relevant</h4>



<p>Some layers or suites of layers have been superseded, upgraded or are highly correlated with other layers.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-available-elsewhere">Whether layers are available elsewhere</h4>



<p>We needed to examine the ALA’s position in light of other related portals, such as the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (<a href="https://bccvl.org.au/">BCCVL</a>). The BCCVL is better suited to provide the multitude of climate model projections, and IMOS’ Australian Ocean Data Network portal (<a href="https://portal.aodn.org.au/">AODN</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://imos.org.au/">IMOS</a>) is better suited to provide oceanographic layers.</p>



<p>Our challenge is to provide a good representative sample of both environmental and contextual layers relevant to biodiversity data analysis, but we want to avoid being overly specialised.</p>



<h3 id="whats-next"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>



<p>Over the coming months we’ll be working on updating and rationalising our layer holdings. This review will be repeated annually. </p>



<h3 id="more-information"><strong>More information</strong></h3>



<p>More comprehensive information and technical detail about this process is provided in our Knowledge Base article ALA&nbsp;<a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000237045-what-are-environmental-and-contextual-spatial-layers-">Environmental and Contextual Spatial Layers</a>, including our criteria for review.</p>



<p>As usual, if you have any questions or comments, please let us know at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear ALA community,</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/fern-after-bushfire.png" alt="" class="wp-image-43755" width="255" height="235" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/fern-after-bushfire.png 854w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/fern-after-bushfire-300x275.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/fern-after-bushfire-768x705.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /><figcaption> King Fern (<em>Todea barbara</em>) observation uploaded to iNaturalist Australia by alpine_flora_of_australia, February 2020 (CC-BY-NC 4.0) </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The start of 2020 has brought many challenges for our nation as we continue to respond to and recover from the bushfire crisis. For the ALA, it’s meant a very different January to the one we expected however we’re proud to have been able to support communities, government and the research sector. </p>



<p>Our team has been working closely with our
colleagues in CSIRO, the Australian Citizen Science Association (ACSA),
universities, museums and collections to respond to the outcomes from the <a href="https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/karenandrews/media-releases/ministerial-statement-bushfire-science-roundtable">bushfire
science roundtable</a> convened by the Hon Karen
Andrews MP, Minister for Industry, Science and Technology in mid-January.
</p>



<p>The ALA is leading a process to identify opportunities
for members of the public to engage in citizen science projects and to maximise
the likelihood of these activities delivering science-ready data. </p>



<p>Despite the tragic impacts on people, and the
natural and built environment, the fires also provide an opportunity to learn, evaluate
and improve how we work across sectors. Ultimately, this work will lead to a
better understanding of the impact of bushfire, and the ability to design
response and recovery programs using the best available national data. </p>

<p>I’d also like to alert you to the recently
released <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA
Future Directions National Consultation Findings Report</a> which is the
culmination of an extensive stakeholder consultation process conducted in late
2019. </p>



<p>We consulted with individuals and groups
representing research, government, education and community sectors. The process
considered what’s been achieved nationally through the formation of the ALA and
provided guidance on where the ALA should focus to maintain its relevance
through the eyes of our stakeholders. Joanne Daly’s report is digestible,
informative and offers lessons beyond the ALA. I encourage you to download a
copy and have a read. </p>



<p>In response to these findings, our team has worked
closely with the ALA Advisory Board and our stakeholders to develop a new
5-year strategy. This is scheduled for release in May-June 2020, with
implementation to commence in July 2020. You’ll learn about this in an upcoming
newsletter. </p>



<p>Kind regards,</p>



<p>Andre Zerger</p>

<p>The number of records being contributed to the ALA via DigiVol’s camera trap projects has increased markedly over the last year due to ALA upgrades improving the storage and processing&nbsp;speed on the DigiVol platform.</p>



<p>The DigiVol platform developed by the Australian Museum in collaboration with the Atlas of Living Australia, is a world-leading collections digitisation platform that invites volunteers to log on to a computer and help digitise and transcribe museum and library images and specimens. There are currently 4000 active DigiVol volunteers in Australia, transcribing for 58 museum and library institutions in Australia and internationally.</p>



<p>Recent upgrades to the DigiVol platform improved the processing
functions to enable faster upload, throughput and rules for self-validation of camera
trap images. Camera traps are used in many different research projects to
monitor the presence of animals in isolated locations and nocturnal animals.</p>



<p>You can use DigiVol’s Wildlife Spotter to help identify species caught by hidden cameras for a variety of research projects across Australia.</p>

<p>“The recent upgrades have resulted in a marked increase in data being captured through the DigiVol camera trap projects. Between August and October there was a 500% increase in the number of tasks completed on DigiVol, with over 180,000 completed in October, mostly as a result of camera trap identifications,” said Paul Flemons, the Manager of Digital Collections and Citizen Science at the Australian Museum who manages the DigiVol project.</p>



<p>“We are quickly coming up to 5000 users and have just
passed 1.5 million tasks completed, and will go close to 2 million before the
end of the year.” </p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that the ALA has recently appointed Dr Diana Day to Chair the ALA Advisory Board. </p>



<p>Diana brings a wealth of board, corporate governance and research sector experience to the role. Her board leadership has included commercial water utilities, statutory authorities, agri-business, commercialisation companies, tertiary education institutions and not-for-profits. Her background working with industry and state government will be particularly valuable as the ALA moves to further develop relationships in this space.</p>



<p>In July this year, we farewelled Dr Patrick
Greene from the role and wish him well in his next role with the Irish
Immigration Museum in Dublin.</p>



<p>The announcement
of a new Chair for the ALA Advisory Board coincides with two other new member
appointments:</p>



<ul><li>Mr Matthew Miles, Principal Environmental Information, South Australian Department for Environment and Water. Matt has responsibility for strategic state-wide biodiversity data management in South Australia and has extensive networks with other state government departments that work in this space. He has a deep understanding of the ALA and its role supporting state and territory business processes and will bring that knowledge to the operation of our board.</li><li>Dr Bek Christensen, Manager, Research Infrastructure Support, Queensland University of Technology and President-elect, Ecological Society of Australia. As the incoming President of the Ecological Society of Australia, Bek will join the board in an ex-officio role representing one of our largest user communities and advocates in the ecological and biological sciences research sector. Working more closely with the ESA complements the strong relationships the ALA has had with the museums and collections community.</li></ul>



<p>Our new appointments also extend the ALA’s board’s geographic footprint to NSW, South Australia and Queensland which is helpful for a national infrastructure. We look forward to welcoming our new board members at our November 22<sup>nd</sup> meeting to be held in Sydney hosted by the Royal Botanic Gardens. </p>



<p>The ALA Advisory Board now comprises the following members:</p>



<ul><li>Chair: Dr Diana Day, Environmental Strategist</li><li>Professor David Cantrill (ex-officio), Executive Director Science, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria</li><li>Dr Lyndall Ley, Executive Director, Return of Cultural Heritage Project, Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies</li><li>Professor Melodie McGeoch, School of Biological Sciences, Monash University</li><li>Mr Matthew Miles, Principal for Environmental Information, South Australian Department for Environment and Water </li><li>Dr Bek Christensen, Manager, Research Infrastructure Support, Queensland University of Technology and President-elect, Ecological Society of Australia</li><li>Ms Toni Moate (ex-officio), Director, National Collections and Marine Infrastructure, CSIRO</li><li>Mr Greg Terrill, Assistant Secretary, Environmental Resources Information Network (ERIN), Department of the Environment and Energy </li><li>Dr Andre Zerger (ex-officio), Director, Atlas of Living Australia</li></ul>

<p>iNaturalist Australia, the Australian node of the global biodiversity platform, launched this month and is now integrated with the Atlas of Living Australia. </p>



<p>iNaturalist Australia greatly improves the ALA’s ability to enable users to upload sightings and identify species. It provides an Australian gateway to iNaturalist for people to share findings with biodiversity-loving people across the globe.</p>



<p>You can upload observations on iNaturalist Australia at <a href="http://inaturalist.ala.org.au">http://inaturalist.ala.org.au</a> on your desktop or using the iNaturalist app on your mobile device (download from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inaturalist/id421397028">App store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.inaturalist.android">Google Play</a>).</p>



<p>All iNaturalist
Australia records are fed into the ALA regularly. If you previously uploaded
sightings to the ALA you can link your accounts and see all your ALA and
iNaturalist records in the ALA.</p>



<p>There are already
over 10,000 iNaturalist users in Australia and the ALA has been receiving data
feeds from iNaturalist for a while. So, to celebrate the launch of iNaturalist
Australia, we caught up with three Australian iNaturalist ‘super users’ and
asked them to share their iNaturalist experiences.</p>



<h3><strong>Entomology enthusiast and iNaturalist user, Karen Retra, helps
identify rare Velvet Ant at home among the Red Gum trees</strong></h3>



<p>During a Trust
for Nature ecological assessment on private land in north east Victoria, the
conservation team looked under some loose bark and
found a scorpion sitting next to an unusual insect they hadn’t seen before.</p>



<p>Keen
to identify exactly what they had found, the conservation team contacted Karen
Retra, a local naturalist. Karen also didn’t know exactly what they were
looking at and quickly recommended posting the observation on iNaturalist in
order to harness identification expertise from entomologists around the world.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/velvet-ant-record-in-iNat.png" alt="" class="wp-image-43281" width="408" height="429"/><figcaption> <a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/observations/28588740"><em>Ephutomorpha quadrisignata </em>record in iNaturalist Australia</a><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em> </figcaption></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/velvet-ant-record-in-ALA.png" alt="" class="wp-image-43282" width="441" height="334" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/velvet-ant-record-in-ALA.png 579w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/velvet-ant-record-in-ALA-300x227.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" /><figcaption>  <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:6b2645d6-9ef1-4fad-b868-053d269fcdb8">Species page for <em>Ephutomorpha quadrisignata</em></a><em> </em><em> </em>in the ALA </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Within days, a
US-based entomologist identified the little critter as&nbsp;<em>Ephutomorpha
quadrisignata</em>, a member of the Velvet Ant family, and previously
unrecorded in Australia. The iNaturalist crowd-sourced identification system
requires two people to confirm the identification before it reaches ‘Research
Grade’. Soon after the first Velvet Ant identification was proposed, it was
confirmed by a renowned Velvet Ant expert, South African Professor Denis
Brothers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/Karen-retra.png" alt="" class="wp-image-43283" width="216" height="144" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/Karen-retra.png 500w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/Karen-retra-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" /><figcaption> Karen Retra, iNaturalist observer</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“This is a really exciting find. It’s the first record of&nbsp;<em>E. quadrisignata</em>&nbsp;in iNaturalist and it is also the only record of the species in the&nbsp;<em>Atlas of Living Australia</em>,” Karen said. </p>



<p>Karen is a keen
naturalist with an interest in pollinator insects (particularly native bees) as
well as living sustainably and conserving natural habitats in north east
Victoria. She has been uploading observations to iNaturalist for the last year
and has over 400 observations for over 200 different species.</p>

<h3><strong>Ralph Foster, Ichthyologist with the South Australian Museum,
joined international effort to identify a giant Hoodwinker Sunfish far from home</strong></h3>



<p>In
February 2019, iNaturalist made&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/28/699004730/scientists-shocked-by-rare-giant-sunfish-washed-up-on-california-beach">international</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47424072">headlines</a>&nbsp;when images of the
first Hoodwinker Sunfish (<em>Mola tecta</em>) to be seen in North America were
shared and identified via iNaturalist. This story shows the power of
iNaturalist’s widespread community of keen observers and expert identifiers. </p>



<p>It
all started when Tom Turner, Associate Professor in Marine Biology at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, found an enormous fish washed up on
beach and uploaded pictures to iNaturalist. Two iNaturalist users with
significant expertise on sunfish then joined in the story; Ralph Foster, an
expert in the diversity
and distributions of fishes in southern Australia, and ichthyology Collections
Manager at the South Australian Museum; and
Marianne Nyegaard, marine biologist at Murdoch University in Western Australia who
first named <em>Mola tecta</em> (Hoodwinker
Sunfish). </p>



<p>Ralph
had an alert set up in his iNaturalist account for Mola genus so he was
notified about the sunfish observation when it was uploaded. He was very surprised
to see this fish was in California because it is usually only found in the
southern hemisphere. He decided to tag Marianne Nyegaard to help with
identifying the fish. Marianne wasn’t able to confirm the identification from the
supplied image because the key features were not clear. So then, Ralph asked
Tom (the original observer) if he could take some more pictures. However, in
that time, the sunfish had washed away. </p>



<p>In
a brilliant twist to the story, two days later the fish washed back ashore, Tom
was back on the beach uploading more pictures, and the quest to identify the
giant fish was back on. Within days iNaturalist’s international community
confirmed this was a rare sighting of <em>Mola
Tecta. </em></p>

<p>“[This
fish has] never recorded from US waters before and it&#8217;s quite a feather in
iNat&#8217;s cap because without it, this would likely have passed unrecognised. To
be able to rapidly arrange for a re-examination of diagnostic characters on the
specimen, from halfway round the world, and have them reported back in real
time is fantastic,” said Ralph.

Ralph has over 2,300 observations on iNaturalist, for over 500 species
and has helped to identify over 26,000 observations, yes 26,000.

<h3 id="donald-hobern-inaugural-director-atlas-of-living-australia-and-lifelong-naturalist"><strong>Donald Hobern, inaugural Director, Atlas of Living Australia, and lifelong naturalist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Donald
Hobern has a long history with the ALA. He was our inaugural Director,
overseeing the early development of Australia’s national database and web
portal for biodiversity data from 2007 to 2012. He went on to become GBIF’s (Global
Biodiversity Information Facility) Executive Secretary and has recently moved
back to Australia from Denmark to be Executive Secretary for the International
Barcode of Life Consortium.</p>



<p>Donald
is a specialist in the mobilisation and use of free and open biodiversity data,
and an advocate of the ALA. However, today we’re going to focus not on his
career achievements but on his lifelong role as an amateur naturalist and his
early adoption of iNaturalist. With 16,079 observations listed in iNaturalist,
covering over 3,800 species he is most definitely a ‘super user’ and he kindly talked
to us about his experiences with iNaturalist.</p>



<p><strong><em>We know you are a keen contributor to iNaturalist, can you describe
how you use it and what features you like the best?</em></strong></p>



<p>“I’ve always been a keen naturalist. I’ve been keeping a diary of
my observations of the natural world since I was little. First, in the form of
physical collections and notes, drawing and labels, then I embraced digital
photography and was an avid user of Flickr. It was a natural progression for me
to start using iNaturalist. Since around 2014, I’ve been using it for all of my
personal observations.”</p>



<p>“I use iNaturalist as my visual diary – it’s perfect for this. I
can document the things I see, look back at when I saw them and where they were.
It also helps me keep track of the first instances of things, like the first
time I saw a particular species, or the first of a family I’d seen in a certain
location.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you have a particular family or genus of interest, or are you
an all-inclusive naturalist?</em></strong></p>



<p>“When I was young, I was very keen on birdwatching and also
developed a keen interest in beetles and moths, but it was very difficult to
explore lesser known groups. The digital revolution has really changed amateur
natural history. And now, I like to keep track of all organisms I see, at home
and as I travel. I have a good collection of casual observations of plants,
fungi, birds and Australian mammals.”</p>



<p>“I’m definitely no expert but I often help with identifying
species in a few families of moth hoping to move observations to Research
Grade. I’m less familiar with beetles, I will often identify to family level,
and then the crowd will help me identify to species level.”</p>



<p><strong><em>What do you like most about iNaturalist?</em></strong></p>



<p>“For me, iNaturalist brings together all the features I need and
it’s easy to use, and it’s great to feel part of a larger international network
of enthusiasts and experts. It’s fabulous to have input from a world-renowned
moth expert living in Europe or South America on an observation I saw in country
New South Wales. There is a long history of amateur naturalists making
significant contributions to western science and iNaturalist enables this.”</p>



<p>“I’m also really interested in how iNaturalist is using machine
learning for image recognition and to assist with identification. Artificial
intelligence (AI) and computer vision helps identifications get closer quicker.
I’d like to see more details about this in the metadata so that users are aware
if the initial ID was established due to AI and computer vision. I am a
biodiversity data specialist so I always want more information about the data!”</p>



<p><strong><em>Can you explain why you like to record your observations of the
natural world?</em></strong></p>



<p>“Amateur natural history helps us get a view of our biodiversity
that’s hard to get through research sampling methods or government surveys.”</p>



<p>“Many of us believe we’re seeing a collapse in insect populations
– less variety and less quantity of insects – but it is difficult to know for
sure without the data. Human observations are a great way to understand this
further and to monitor changes over time. Through recording observations we can
contribute to the pool of data that will help the broader scientific community lay
down a baseline so we can understand the changes that are happening now, and that
have happened over time.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you have a favourite observation?</em></strong><em></em></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/Donald-Hobern-fav-observation.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-43292" width="322" height="296" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/Donald-Hobern-fav-observation.jpg 308w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/10/Donald-Hobern-fav-observation-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" /></figure></div>



<p>“Yes, but it’s not an Australian one, it&#8217;s from Denmark. I picked up a tiny wasp from a leaf and was amazed to be able to key it out (<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/557101"><em><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/7476519">Halticoptera laevigata</a></em></a><em>) </em>AND to see how this wasp kept pushing the enormously swollen base of its maxillary palpi out from the side of its head (that&#8217;s the sickly green disk you can see in the image) AND to find that there was no record of the species having been recorded previously in the Denmark (although it occurs in Germany and Sweden).” </p>



<p><strong><em>Finally, do you have any tips for new iNaturalist users?</em></strong></p>



<p>“If you’re uploading multiple images at a time, make sure your
camera is in the right time zone so that the correct date and time data is
entered automatically when you upload the image – this saves a lot of time.”</p>

<p>Although the ALA is a relatively mature national biodiversity data infrastructure, as a team we continue to explore ways to improve the utility of the data we provide users. One element of this challenge is to ensure we continue to deliver usable data in an environment where we are primarily an aggregator and where data origin varies.</p>
<p>ALA data range from specimen records from Australia’s natural history collections, ecological survey data from state government and research programs, and species occurrence records from citizen science activities including both opportunistic observations and citizen science programs that operate within a structured survey design framework such as Birdlife Australia.</p>
<p>In regard to this data diversity and indeed data volume, I’ve become aware of some recent research led by a team from the University of Queensland published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution titled <span><em><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00239/full">Do Big Unstructured Biodiversity Data Mean More Knowledge</a></em></span><em>? </em>The study is set in context of global and national ecological change detection including for assessing species declines and primarily evaluates both the role of remote sensing and citizen science data in supporting such assessments.</p>
<p>What does such research mean for the ALA? Foremost it highlights the importance of the ALA working more closely with our user community in designing a fit-for-purpose national biodiversity data infrastructure. And second, it highlights the need to better communicate the diversity of our data to users to ensure their use of the ALA is informed by an appropriate understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Our team will be initiating a new data quality project in 2019-20 to address these and related challenges informed by our user community and contemporary research such as the research highlighted above.</p>
<h4 id="ala-future-directions-national-consultation"><strong>ALA Future Directions – National Consultation</strong></h4>
<p>Questions around data quality and quantity, fit-for-use data and data standards are essential to the long-term success of a national biodiversity infrastructure and are one of our key lines of enquiry for our national consultation – <strong>ALA Future Directions</strong>.</p>
<p>This month, we kicked off our national consultation process meeting with our major stakeholders and user groups and I&#8217;m really looking forward to collating the results and implementing a strategy to guide the ALA into its second decade.</p>
<p>For more information, read <span><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation/">ALA Future Directions – National Consultation</a></span>.</p>
<p>There is always such a great number of projects and exciting stories that we review for our ALA newsletter. I hope you find something in this current edition that sheds light on an area of the ALA you didn’t know about or that celebrates an area you are familiar with.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
