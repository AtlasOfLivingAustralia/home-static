<p>The ALA Data Quality project team is working hard to complete and release its first piece of software. But there&#8217;s still time to test and provide feedback.</p>



<p>Since the Data Quality Project launched in February, the team has been working with the ALA user community to identify data quality issues and develop solutions.  Thank you to everyone who has completed our surveys, contributed to baseline perceptions of data quality, helped to prioritise issues, or tested solutions so far. </p>



<p><strong> First proposed software release – improvements to data filters</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to issues identified in our data quality survey (see below), the project team are developing a new capability to pre-filter search results. This means lower quality records will not be shown unless they are actively included. </p>



<p>The new software will enable users to switch filters&nbsp;on&nbsp;or&nbsp;off&nbsp;and manage&nbsp;them&nbsp;as a group or&nbsp;individually. Information&nbsp;is available on the&nbsp;fields and data that make up the filters&nbsp;through mouse-over text and&nbsp;clickable info icons (i).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are still testing the new software and welcome your feedback. </p>



<h4 id="how-to-test-the-software">How to test the software</h4>



<ol><li>Sign in to our ALA <a href="https://biocache-dq-test.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=*%3A*">Test Environment</a>. </li><li>View the filters in the new user interface (UI) element above the search results. </li><li>Interact with the filters, noting how they work for you.</li><li>Email any comments or feedback to <a href="mailto:dataquality@ala.org.au">dataquality@ala.org.au</a>.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Priori</strong><strong>ti</strong><strong>sation survey</strong><strong>&nbsp;results</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>After establishing a baseline for perceptions of data quality (<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/data-quality-project-baseline-survey-results/">see results</a>), we conducted a prioritisation survey. This helped to identify which issues the data quality project should address first. The top two issues identified were: </p>



<ul><li>ALA users are using data accessed via the ALA without filtering out records that are not fit for purpose. </li><li>Due to data quality indicators not being present, users are often unsure whether to use particular records or datasets. </li></ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Two of Australia’s most iconic ecosystems, eucalypt trees and reef corals, could end up being the ‘best of pals’ when it comes to fighting climate change.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br><em>This story was written by Amy Edwards and first appeared in <a href="https://ecos.csiro.au/">ECOS,</a> CSIRO&#8217;s environmental and sustainability science news.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44072" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/flickr_fires_ECOS.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Burnt Eucalypts regenerating on Putty Road, NSW near the Hunter Valley following the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season.

<p>On the surface marine animals such as reef corals and plant species like eucalypts sound very different.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Sure they are both iconic Australian species but could they really end up being best mates in the fight against climate change?</p>



<p>“You betcha,” according to native forest specialist Dr Trevor Booth from CSIRO and coral researcher Dr Paul Muir from the Museum of Tropical Queensland.</p>



<p>The scientists have teamed up to highlight these important Australian ecosystems and their similarities in biology and vulnerability to rapid climate change.</p>



<p>Their paper&nbsp;<em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.657">Climate change impacts on Australia’s eucalypt and coral species: Comparing and sharing knowledge across disciplines</a></em>&nbsp;has been published in the online journal WIREs Climate Change.</p>



<h2 id="same-same-but-different">Same, same but different</h2>



<p>There are many similarities in the biology of eucalypts and corals. They are both long-lived, unmoving organisms that can reproduce asexually, but also sexually by broadcasting very large quantities of tiny offspring. Corals are the most plant-like of all animals, deriving much of their energy from photosynthesis via microscopic algae that live symbiotically within their tissues. But perhaps most importantly, eucalypts and reef corals are the key foundation species in their respective ecosystems, providing much of the framework that hundreds of thousands of other species rely upon.</p>



<p>“Losing these key foundation species would be catastrophic for many of our most diverse ecosystems,” Booth said.</p>



<p>“Coral is the more vulnerable of the two groups when it comes to climate change but both collections of species have been and will be significantly affected.”</p>

<p>Eucalyptus trees and reef corals are on the front line of many climate change impacts. Just in the past six months, eucalypts have suffered heavy losses from the catastrophic 2019-2020 Australian bushfires linked to extreme climate events. Corals have suffered mortalities from moderate to severe&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/news-room/latest-news/latest-news/coral-bleaching/2020/statement-coral-bleaching-on-the-great-barrier-reef">coral bleaching</a>&nbsp;associated with unusually high seawater temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef.</p>



<p>“By comparing research efforts, eucalypt and reef coral workers might benefit from each other’s experiences,” Muir said.</p>



<p>“Researchers are putting huge efforts into understanding these threats, likely future changes and how we can manage these systems to prevent species extinctions.”</p>



<p>One example where knowledge could be usefully shared is in the prediction of changes to species distributions that will occur from climate change impacts.</p>



<h2 id="how-are-a-plant-and-animal-species-going-to-help-each-other-to-fight-climate-change">How are a plant and animal species going to help each other to fight climate change?</h2>



<p>CSIRO researchers made pioneering advances in developing species distribution modelling or&nbsp;<a href="https://csiropedia.csiro.au/bioclim/">SDM</a>, which determines how environmental factors such as mean annual temperature and rainfall of the driest quarter shape a species distribution. More recently, eucalypt researchers from various agencies have predicted likely future changes in species distribution under various climate change scenarios. These results are critical for managing ecosystems, for example by identifying particularly vulnerable species and tailoring management responses to prevent species declines. Researchers have spent many years working collaboratively with other colleagues and institutions developing the large datasets of species distributions and environmental conditions that are required for SDM analyses. In contrast, SDM analyses have only rarely been used in coral research but could provide important information for managing the future of reefs.</p>



<p>“I am hoping the work we have done with eucalypts can help coral researchers benefit from these methods and avoid some of the traps,” Booth said.</p>



<p>Four key areas of research Booth and Muir considered in the journal article were:</p>



<p>(1) modelling current distributions,</p>



<p>(2) assessing impacts of climate change on future distributions,</p>



<p>(3) using human-assisted migration to improve survival and</p>



<p>(4) applying genetic enhancement to improve species’ survival.</p>



<p>With many years of examining the climatic tolerances of eucalypts, it is not surprising that experience from eucalypt studies may have more to offer climate change studies of corals than vice versa. However coral studies are successfully and rapidly applying novel spatial, controlled environment and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.csiro.au/heat-resistant-coral/">genomic methods</a>&nbsp;to assess how coral species may adapt to changing climatic conditions.</p>

The reef is situated in the central GBR off Townsville. Image by Paul Muir.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For their research, the authors extensively used the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a>&nbsp;that provides an online repository for both terrestrial and marine data along with a suite of tools to analyse these data.</p>



<p>“The marine section of the data base is not used as much as it could be so it would be great if our journal article prompts more coral researchers and community members to use it and enhance existing datasets of coral species distribution and environmental conditions,” Booth said.</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia also supports and integrates the extensive national citizen science community into its data system.</p>



<h2 id="two-unlikely-fellows">Two unlikely fellows</h2>



<p>Booth and Muir, and the partnership they formed for their research, was almost as unlikely as their subject matter.</p>



<p>“I was listening to the ABC ‘Science Show’ in February 2019 and they had a program on coral spawning and assisted evolution work taking place at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in Townsville,” Booth said.</p>



<p>“I thought to myself ‘that’s an awful lot like the work we are doing with eucalypts’ and that prompted this exchange of ideas<strong>.”</strong></p>



<p>Booth got in touch with a contact at AIMS who introduced him to Muir at the Museum and the collaboration began. All three organisations contributed to some early discussions relevant to the final journal paper.</p>



<p>“At first I thought it was a bit of a strange idea, but I soon realised the potential of the research. And I do take an interest in trees as I live on a large property,” Muir said.</p>



<p>“I’m very fortunate Paul was willing to continue,” Booth joked.</p>



<p>However the partnership came about, both scientists agree “there’s a lot to be learnt from looking outside the box of one’s own research area”.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We updated the ALA's taxonomy between Monday 17 February and Thursday 21 February 2020. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/taxonomic-framework-icon-orange-trans-471x441-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-43617" width="221" height="207" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/taxonomic-framework-icon-orange-trans-471x441-1.png 471w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/taxonomic-framework-icon-orange-trans-471x441-1-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>The ALA regularly updates its taxonomy from taxonomic directories to ensure that information in the ALA reflects current thinking about the classification of species.</p>



<p>During the update, the ALA data store was inconsistent. This meant that for three to four days, some records were re-processed with the new taxonomy and some were not yet updated. </p>



<p>This did not affect most day-to-day ALA operations, such as searching for records or mapping, since most ALA functions use a prepared index of the data store, optimised for searching. However, if you looked at an individual record you might have found references to classifications not yet updated in the ALA&#8217;s main database. During updates like this, we recommend that you wait until the update completes until you access research data. </p>



<p>The update took four days to complete and all ALA applications have returned to being consistent. </p>



<h3 id="what-was-updated">What was updated?</h3>



<p>The new taxonomy contains a major improvement for certain plant names. Known scientific names for plants not yet placed by the Australian Plant Census have previously been simply placed under the kingdom Plantae. We are now using contextual information supplied by the plant name data to help place these names more accurately in the taxonomic tree. For example, <em>Abroma fastuosa</em> is now correctly placed as a member of <em>Abroma</em> genus in the Malvaceae (Mallow) family, and many wallabies that were in the <em>Macropus </em>genus are now in the <em>Notamacropus </em>genus. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/Australian-magpie-image-uploaded-to-iNaturalist-Australia-by-leithalb-CC-BY-NC-Intsmall.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-43634" width="259" height="173" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/Australian-magpie-image-uploaded-to-iNaturalist-Australia-by-leithalb-CC-BY-NC-Intsmall.jpg 612w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/Australian-magpie-image-uploaded-to-iNaturalist-Australia-by-leithalb-CC-BY-NC-Intsmall-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px" /><figcaption>Australian Magpie image uploaded to iNaturalist Australia by leithalb (CC-BY-NC-Int)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Another update that many ALA users may notice is a name change for the Australian Magpie. The scientific name for Australian Magpie used to be <em>Cracticus tibicen</em>, it is now <em>Gymnorhina tibicen.</em>  It now sits in its own&nbsp;genus&nbsp;<em>Gymnorhina</em>.&nbsp;The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek&nbsp;<em>gumnos</em>&nbsp;for &#8220;naked&#8221; or &#8220;bare&#8221; and&nbsp;<em>rhis</em>,&nbsp;<em>rhinos</em>&nbsp;&#8220;nostrils&#8221;. More information on Magpie taxonomy is available on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpie">Australian Magpie Wikipedia page</a> and in this article <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-british-ornithologists-club/volume-138/issue-4/bboc.v138i4.2018.a6/The-generic-taxonomy-of-the-Australian-Magpie-and-Australo-Papuan/10.25226/bboc.v138i4.2018.a6.full">The generic taxonomy of the Australian Magpie and Australo-Papuan butcherbirds is not all black-and-white</a> by Martin Cake (Murdoch University), Andrew Black (South Australian Museum) and Leo Joseph (CSIRO). </p>

					<description><![CDATA[From monitoring fish species on reefs to mapping microbes in soils or searching for evidence of a monster in Loch Ness, eDNA based surveys are a scientific frontier. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Short for environmental DNA, eDNA is the DNA found in cells shed by plants, animals and microbes into the environment, just as we shed hair and skin cells. Thanks to enhanced DNA sequencing processes and DNA barcode reference libraries, there are now survey techniques that allow organisms in many cases to be detected and identified to the species level without even seeing them.</p>
<p>Environmental DNA surveys can generally be divided into two types: specifically targeted surveys focused on a single species; and broad-based surveys providing an overall sweep of taxonomic presence in a particular environmental medium.</p>
<h2 id="edna-data-is-helping-to-answer-many-different-research-questions">eDNA data is helping to answer many different research questions</h2>
<p>Uptake of eDNA as a biomonitoring tool by government and industry is growing rapidly. eDNA is quickly becoming a standard tool in the environmental scientist’s kit.</p>
<h3 id="searching-for-nessie">Searching for Nessie</h3>
<p>eDNA continues to be used in surprising ways, with a team of researchers from New Zealand sampling water from Loch Ness in Scotland to search for evidence of sharks, seals, plesiosaurs and other imagined candidates for the Loch Ness Monster. What did they find? Plenty of eels. What other cryptic species can you imagine searching for?</p>
<h3 id="mapping-soil-microbiomes">Mapping soil Microbiomes</h3>
<p>The Australian Microbiome Project has mapped the soil and marine microbiomes of Australia spanning the entire Australian continent and covering its marine waters from Antarctic to Christmas Island. The team is now characterising the function of microbes in different ecosystems.</p>
<h3 id="detecting-reef-species">Detecting reef species</h3>
<p>On reefs, eDNA can provide a shortcut for detecting species. CSIRO researcher Cindy Bessey compared conventional and eDNA methods of detecting tropical fish species on the reefs surrounding Browse Island to the north of Australia. Cindy watched 100 hours of underwater video footage recorded over two years and counted 99 species of tropical fishes. Combining her efforts with other researchers, who used multiple approaches from video to diving, a total of 200 fish species were identified. Alternatively, using eDNA techniques on water sampled at two locations from just one trip to Browse Island, Cindy detected 209 fish species. Her team is now refining methods for filtering eDNA from seawater.</p>
<p>Cindy’s upcoming paper in the journal <em>Environmental DNA</em>, describing a fish biodiversity survey of a remote tropical atoll, will link to the associated eDNA records on ALA. This should become commonplace.</p>
<p>Other teams are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219304294">testing living sponges</a> for their inherent ability to monitor the animals surrounding them.</p>
<h3 id="making-data-more-accessible">Making data more accessible</h3>
<p>“In eDNA we generate millions of DNA barcodes in a single experiment &#8211; rather than this data languishing on someone’s computer or hiding on a database &#8211; it is vital we explore ways to make the data accessible,” said Prof. Michael Bunce, Chief Scientist, Environmental Protection Authority, New Zealand.</p>
<p>“The incorporation of eDNA data alongside other biological data within ALA is a world first, it provides a way for everyone to use and re-use the data. The integration of biological datasets like this is vital as we build more nuanced tools to understand how our environment is changing around us.”</p>
<h2 id="edna-data-in-the-ala">eDNA data in the ALA</h2>
<p>“The Atlas of Living Australia is continually growing. We now have over 85 million species occurrence records and we’re looking to include new types of data, including eDNA,” says ALA Director Andre Zerger.</p>
<p>“We’ve worked closely with research communities to figure out the best way to present eDNA in the ALA and we’re pleased this type of data is now available and accessible to our users.”</p>
<p>So far, eDNA data uploaded into the ALA includes:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last week the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), an intergovernmental body of 105 member countries and 127 participating organisations, hosted GEO Week 2019 and a Ministerial Summit in Canberra.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/GEO-week-logo_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-43374" width="251" height="80" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/GEO-week-logo_2.png 729w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/GEO-week-logo_2-300x95.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" /></figure></div>



<p>GEO Week is an annual event and
the accompanying Ministerial Summit is only held once every four years. It was
the first time GEO Week was held in Oceania, and was one of the world’s largest
gatherings of Earth observation practitioners and policy makers. </p>



<p><strong>ALA at GEO Week 2019</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/Andre-Zerger-and-Lindsay-Morgan-at-NCRIS-stand-Geo-Week-2019-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-43359" width="412" height="311"/><figcaption>Andre Zerger and Lindsay Morgan at the NCRIS stand, GEO Week 2019.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia co-hosted a side event with the Global Biodiversity information facility (GBIF) and the GEO Biodiversity Observation Network (BON) titled ‘<em>Biodiversity data infrastructures for supporting global biodiversity monitoring and assessment programs’</em>, and participated in the Australia booth and National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) stand. </p>



<p>The event heard from users
working along the biodiversity data value chain, from data collection and
aggregation to scientists working with the data, to policymakers using science
to make informed policy decisions. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/GEO-BON-Laetitia-Navarro-presenting-at-the-ALA-side-event-GEO-Week-2019-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-43358" width="409" height="307" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/GEO-BON-Laetitia-Navarro-presenting-at-the-ALA-side-event-GEO-Week-2019-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/GEO-BON-Laetitia-Navarro-presenting-at-the-ALA-side-event-GEO-Week-2019-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/GEO-BON-Laetitia-Navarro-presenting-at-the-ALA-side-event-GEO-Week-2019-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/GEO-BON-Laetitia-Navarro-presenting-at-the-ALA-side-event-GEO-Week-2019-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/GEO-BON-Laetitia-Navarro-presenting-at-the-ALA-side-event-GEO-Week-2019.jpg 1664w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /><figcaption> GEO BON&#8217;s Laetitia Navarro presenting at the ALA side event, GEO Week 2019.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>GEO BON (Laetitia Navarro) and
GBIF (Donald Hobern) provided an overview of the state of biodiversity data
observation networks and aggregators world-wide. CSIRO’s Simon Ferrier talked
about their biodiversity data, and specifically data from the ALA, to predict
how biodiversity will respond to environmental changes. The Department of
Environment and Energy (Jeanette Corbitt) discussed the use of such science to support
State of the Environment (SoE) reporting, which informs government policy.</p>



<p>All presenters agreed on the
importance of obtaining high quality data, and on using existing data to
identify data gaps and inform further data collection. </p>



<p>“GEO Week was an important
event for the ALA and a great opportunity to deepen relationships with
Australian government and international agencies that are potential users of ALA’s
data and spatial analysis tools,” said ALA Director, Andre Zerger.</p>



<p>“It also provided an excellent
forum to meet new people and build connections in the global Earth observation and
biodiversity research communities.”</p>



<p><strong>What are Earth observations?</strong></p>

This visualisation shows Australian River Red Gums under increasing stress in drier conditions predicted towards 2030.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Scientists and science agencies
gather information about our Earth in many ways, including from floating ocean
buoys, land stations, and satellites orbiting and observing Earth. Data
collected this way enable environmental, resources and disaster management monitoring
and assessment. </p>



<p>Through data sharing and
infrastructure, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) improves availability,
access and use of Earth observations for research across many sectors including
space, agriculture, water and biodiversity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In 2018, the WA government launched the Index of Biodiversity Surveys for Assessments (IBSA) to improve the availability of environmental data to support planning and development applications. One year on, the impact and value of the data hub is clear.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People conducting biodiversity surveys for environmental impact assessments (EIA) associated with development applications are required to submit survey data to relevant regulatory authorities as part of the approvals process. EIA is a costly process and sometimes, especially when multiple approvals are required, can take a long time and involve duplicated effort.</p>
<p>Approximately 500 biodiversity surveys are conducted for EIA in Western Australia each year. The data collected in these site assessments is often extensive and contains many valuable species records, spatial information and a survey report which interprets the data.</p>
<p>Until recently, this biodiversity data was not consolidated and was rarely shared. In acknowledgement of this situation, WA’s government, industry representatives and environmental consultants had been calling for a mechanism to make this biodiversity data more accessible and re-usable.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_43377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43377" style="width: 483px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" wp-image-43377" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/IBSA-300x224.png" alt="" width="483" height="361" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/IBSA-300x224.png 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/IBSA-768x573.png 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/IBSA-1024x764.png 1024w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/IBSA-640x480.png 640w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/IBSA.png 1643w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-43377" class="wp-caption-text">The IBSA portal on ALA&#8217;s BioCollect tool.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>The IBSA solution</strong></p>
<p>Led by the WA Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, the WA Environmental Protection Authority and the WA Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, in collaboration with the WA Biodiversity Science Institute (WABSI) and with the input of stakeholders including mining companies and environmental consultants, WA has established a nationally-leading programme for sharing the biodiversity survey data and metadata that result from environmental assessments.</p>
<p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) was approached to provide the digital infrastructure solution and expertise in biodiversity data management and has played a key role in enabling the capture and distribution of this biodiversity information, which is critical for WA’s approvals process.</p>
<p>The result is <strong>IBSA – the Index of Biodiversity Surveys for Assessments</strong> – an online portal for land-based biodiversity survey data in Western Australia. IBSA is hosted on the ALA’s data collection tool, <strong>BioCollect</strong>. It provides a central public register of surveys moving through the approvals process and enables efficient data sharing by allowing data to be uploaded to projects and shared with all relevant stakeholders at the same time.</p>
<p>IBSA was launched in 2018 and one year on, we’re already seeing the impact it is having on data availability and usability in the sector.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Impact and outcomes</strong></p>
<p>There are already almost 450 surveys in the IBSA system, with over 350 available in the public web portal while others await upload when the relevant assessments conclude.</p>
<p>The IBSA surveys represent over 180 different proponents from mining, agricultural, local government and other development types throughout Western Australia. The majority of assessments are associated with applications for permits to clear native vegetation, under assessment by the WA Department of Water and Environmental Regulation and the WA Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, while the remainder are associated with significant proposals under assessment by the WA Environmental Protection Authority.</p>
<p>More than half of the surveys in IBSA have data sets and reports attached that the relevant proponents have allowed to be published in full on the platform. Excitingly, in almost half of cases the proponent has licensed the survey data for re-use under a Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 licence – this means that, subject to some simple conditions, third parties can freely re-use the information for their own research or projects. This proportion is expected to increase as proponents become more familiar with the role of IBSA in the assessment process.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Index of Biodiversity Surveys for Assessments is a ground-breaking initiative that will promote the sharing of vital biodiversity data obtained as part of the environmental assessment process,&#8221; said WA Acting Environment Minister Hon Francis Logan BA (Hons) MLA.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating a central and accessible index for this data will deliver greater efficiencies for the public and private sector, aid with decision making and most importantly it will have lasting benefits for Western Australia&#8217;s flora and fauna,&#8221; concluded Minister Logan.</p>
<p><strong>Proponent data and the ALA</strong></p>
<p>Flora and fauna occurrence data can also be accessed under licence from surveys in IBSA and imported into the state and national (ALA) biodiversity data repositories, where it can then be used for other biodiversity research and environmental decision making. Whilst this is not currently part of the IBSA process, the ALA is looking forward to being able to make the IBSA data more accessible and versatile for end-users.</p>
<p>The ALA’s broad user base – spanning ecoscience researchers, natural resource managers, and government departments – recognises the value of proponent data and is looking forward to the opportunity to access it on the ALA.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What is proponent data? </em></p>
<p><em>Biodiversity data contained in Environmental Impact Assessments submitted as part of development applications.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How IBSA works</strong></p>
<p>Proponents (private development companies, environmental consultants etc) who conduct land-based biodiversity surveys to support applications for native vegetation clearing permits, works approvals and licences; or referrals to regulatory authorities of proposals and schemes are required to submit an electronic data package.</p>
<p>The relevant agencies then submit the data to IBSA during the assessment or compliance process on the proponent’s behalf.</p>
<p>Once data has been used for assessment purposes, WA Department of Water and Environmental Regulation makes basic information for each data set – the metadata – available online via IBSA. Data owners have control over how accessible the complete data sets are.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Data providers are the backbone of the ALA, providing authoritative data for species names and classification, geospatial references, environmental layers, and species occurrence data. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><figure id="attachment_40214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40214" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ANIC-CSIRO-300x103.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="213" class=" wp-image-40214"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40214" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Australian National Insect Collection, CSIRO.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The main function of the ALA is to enable users to access, visualise and analyse biodiversity data (predominantly occurrence records &#8211; where plants and animals are). In order to do this, the ALA needs authoritative reference lists and resources to provide context to the data, and to enable users to search, filter, analyse and visualise the data.</p>
<p>The most obvious reference information critical to the ALA is naming and taxonomy data.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_40210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40210" style="width: 387px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/australiaNZspecies-300x179.png" alt="" width="387" height="231" class=" wp-image-40210"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40210" class="wp-caption-text">The estimated number of living named (green) and un-named (orange) species in Australia and New Zealand. The yellow slices represent the average number of new species discovered and named per decade. Source: Discovering Biodiversity: A decadal plan for taxonomy and biosystematics in Australia and New Zealand 2018-2027.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Names and classification: science fundamentals</strong></p>
<p>The science of naming and classifying species (taxonomy) is dynamic and constantly changing. Only 30 per cent of the estimated 830,000 species in Australia and New Zealand have been described and named.</p>
<p><strong>Call in the experts: Australia’s authorities on species names and classifications</strong></p>
<p>The ALA uses a variety of authoritative lists for Australian taxa and these are used to build the names and taxonomic hierarchy applied to all occurrence records supplied to the ALA. The species name that data providers give to the ALA in occurrence records (supplied name) is matched to these lists and becomes the name (processed name) by which the record is displayed, matched and synthesised. This is so the vast amount of data supplied to the ALA can be aggregated and presented in a consistent and meaningful way.</p>
<p>These lists are built and maintained on behalf of the community by a number of key players that maintain the names and taxonomy of Australian flora and fauna; these are the <span><a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/science/abrs">Australian Biological Resources Study</a></span> (ABRS) working with the member institutions of the <span><a href="http://chah.org.au/">Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria</a></span> (CHAH) and <span><a href="http://chafc.org.au/">Council of Heads of Australian Faunal Collections (CHAFC)</a></span> to provide national leadership for the discovery, naming and classification of Australia’s living organisms. It is their role to keep up to date with changes in taxonomy. The primary sources of name and taxonomic resources for Australian species come from the:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/science/abrs/online-resources/fauna">Australian Faunal Directory</a></span> (AFD) which provides the ALA with names and taxonomy for Australian fauna</li>
<li><span><a href="https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/apni">Australian Plant Name Index (APNI)</a> and <a href="https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/apc">Australian Plant Census (APC)</a></span> for Australian vascular plants</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/science/projects/taxonomy/atlas-of-living-australia-national-species-lists-project">AusFungi</a></span> and <span><a href="https://moss.biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/apni">AusMoss</a></span> for fungi and mosses respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope of these resources focuses on organisms found in Australia and surrounding waters, however as the ALA also includes occurrence records for organisms found in New Zealand, Antarctica, the South Pacific and many other places it also needs to incorporate other sources. Recently the <span><a href="http://www.nzor.org.nz/">New Zealand Organism Register</a></span> has been included in this list.</p>
<p><strong>Conservation lists</strong></p>
<p>Each state and territory government, as well as the federal government and international bodies, maintain conservation species lists. The classifications within the lists are based on the categories provided by the <span><a href="https://www.iucn.org/">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a></span> ranging from Least Concern, Near Threatened and Vulnerable through to Critically Endangered and Extinct, but there are some variations to category names in each state and territory. Each state and territory is responsible for providing up-to-date conservation information.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_40226" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40226" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chrome_2018-11-28_10-11-01-264x300.png" alt="" width="520" height="591" class="wp-image-40226"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40226" class="wp-caption-text">ALA species pages display the conservation status below the featured image. On this species page for the Collared Kingfisher you can see the currently accepted scientific name, its conservation status (Least Concern in the Northern Territory), and the 4,980 occurrence records displayed on a map.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Spatial and environmental layers</strong></p>
<p>In addition to names, taxonomy and conservation information, the ALA also needs authoritative reference lists for the environmental layers and geospatial mapping information used to visualise and interrogate data.</p>
<p>Spatial information such as geospatial references, specific boundaries of environmental protected areas, and state and territory boundaries enable ALA users to look at what species live in particularly defined areas. A key provider of this type of information is the <span><a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/capad">Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy</a></span>.</p>
<p>Access to environment information, such as humidity, temperature and rainfall figures, enables ALA users to interrogate species occurrences by these environmental factors. For example, which species only occur in high rainfall areas, or alpine areas with high altitude, cold climate and complex topography. Two key providers of environmental information are <span><a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/">Geoscience Australia</a></span> and <span><a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares">Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences</a></span> (ABARES).</p>
<p><strong>Species occurrence records</strong></p>
<p>The ALA’s bread and butter is the 78.5 million (and growing) occurrence records. This information is provided by collections institutions (including museums and herbaria), government departments, researchers, community groups and individuals.</p>
<p>A few key players in each of the groups that provide occurrence records data to the ALA, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>the <a href="https://avh.chah.org.au/">Australasian Virtual Herbarium</a> (AVH)</span> which provides access to 6.8 million records from herbaria in all Australian states and territories and New Zealand</li>
<li><span>the <a href="http://ozcam.org.au/">Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums (OZCAM)</a> aggregates 5.1 million records from all Australian states and territories, plus the CSIRO National Collections </span></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bionet.nsw.gov.au/">BioNet</a>, the Atlas of NSW Wildlife, contributes over 10 million records</li>
<li><span><a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">Bird Life Australia</a></span>, Australia’s largest bird conservation organisation, has uploaded 13.6 million individual records</li>
<li>a total of 84, 395 individual sightings have been uploaded directly to the ALA by citizen scientists; to view these, visit <span><a href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/bioActivity/projectRecords/f813c99c-1a1d-4096-8eeb-cbc40e321101?hub=sightings">Recent sightings.</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>ALA is the tip of the iceberg</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully this brief summary of the ALA’s data providers sheds some light on the amount of information accessible via the ALA, and importantly explains that the ALA is a mere window into the vast, complex world of biodiversity science. The work of the organisations and institutions that provide data, and manage, curate and update that data, is fundamental to the success of the ALA.</p>
<p>This is an ode to our data providers – essentially, without them we’re nothing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ALA now allows users to see a history of their occurrence record downloads. We have also introduced the automatic creation of a ‘digital object identifier’ (DOI) for every new download. DOIs are persistent identifiers, similar to a webpage URL, that are already widely used in scientific publications and for scientific data sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALA users can see a history of their occurrence record downloads using the&nbsp;&#8216;<a href="https://biocache.ala.org.au/download/myDownloads/">View your downloaded records&#8217;</a>&nbsp;link, on the &#8216;My profile&#8217; page. Users can re-download previous downloaded files and they can also re-run the search associated with a download.</p>
<p>Another new feature is the automatic creation of a &#8216;digital object identifier&#8217; (DOI) for every new download. With every download now having a DOI, it will be easier for scientists to link their publications with the &#8216;source&#8217; download data from the ALA. This will allow both the ALA and original data providers (museums, herbaria and citizen science projects) to track the use of their data through to publications and impact.</p>
