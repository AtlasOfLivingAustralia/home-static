<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.caudit.edu.au/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Council of Australasian University Directors of Information Technology (CAUDIT)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a not-for-profit association of all universities in Australia and New Zealand and some in the Asia Pacific region, as well as a number of major Australian research organisations. The association’s purpose is to support the application of digital capabilities to transform education and research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year CAUDIT held its first awards program to recognise, celebrate and promote the outstanding achievements and innovation of IT staff working in CAUDIT member organisations, and the application of digital capabilities which positively transform the experience of students, academics and professional staff.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecoEd, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">an innovative training and skills development program for university lecturers, researchers and industry professionals, was selected as a finalist in the category Innovation in Teaching and Learning alongside four other outstanding projects from Curtin University, Deakin University, Griffith University, and University of Wollongong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr Chantal Huijbers, manager of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecoEd</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, attended the awards night on Wednesday, 22 May in Wollongong and said that despite not walking away with the award being recognised a finalist was a major achievement for a project still in its infancy.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_40649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40649" style="width: 728px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/ecoEd_CauditAward_0R4A6917_800-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="485" class="wp-image-40649 " srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/ecoEd_CauditAward_0R4A6917_800-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/ecoEd_CauditAward_0R4A6917_800-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/ecoEd_CauditAward_0R4A6917_800-1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40649" class="wp-caption-text">Dr Chantal Huijbers (middle) at the CAUDIT Awards night representing ecoEd as a finalist together with Gina White (right), CAUDIT President, and Andrew Boag (left), Managing Director of Catalyst, sponsor of the Innovation in Teaching and Learning category.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although &nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecoEd</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wasn’t selected as the winner in the category, which went to the Student Digital Workspace project by Griffith University, it was well deserved recognition of the work we’ve achieved in bringing Australia’s digital research infrastructures to the EcoScience community and educating and upskilling the next generation of environmental scientists and managers,” says Chantal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the perfect motivation and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecoEd</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will continue its work to enhance the integration of digital research infrastructures into undergraduate environmental science education.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecoEd</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a range of </span><a href="http://ecoed.org.au/materials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educational materials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in ready-to-use lecture and workshop modules that can be easily adapted by academics and integrated in undergraduate courses. The program is uplifting the skills of students and their supervisors and providing a uniquely innovative perspective to integrating digital technologies in teaching and learning practices at Australian universities.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecoEd</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a partnership between NCRIS capabilities the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecocloud</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the online platform for the ecosystem science community, and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN), and industry partner the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES).</span></li>

Whether you&#8217;re running a bug blitz, or counting and identifying birds, your school&#8217;s own citizen science project page will make adding your future sightings easier and will keep all sightings together in one data set.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of using ALA in the classroom</strong></p>
<p>Recording the biodiversity in your schoolyard is a great first step in helping students understand the importance of biodiversity in building healthy ecosystems and supporting resilient environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_39386" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39386" style="width: 316px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/plover-264x300.jpg" alt="A close up image of two plover birds, common visitors to school yards" class=" wp-image-39386" width="316" height="359"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39386" class="wp-caption-text">Masked Plovers (Vanellus (Lobipluvia) miles) are common visitors to school ovals across eastern Australia. Image by Peter Davey.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>This is also a great way to showcase the success of your school&#8217;s existing habitat development areas, like frog bogs, wildlife corridors or butterfly gardens, or to gather data to plan for something new in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>So teachers! We are letting you know early so you can encourage your students to take images of plants, animals or fungi in the schoolyard. Any images uploaded by teachers between now and the start of National Science Week will be entered into the competition.</p>
<p><strong>The competition rules are simple:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The image must be taken in or close to the school yard and logged directly into the ALA by teachers (please don’t email us your photo – <a href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/bioActivity/create/e61eb018-02a9-4e3b-a4b3-9d6be33d9cbb?returnTo=%2Fsightings%2FbioActivity%2FprojectRecords%2Ff813c99c-1a1d-4096-8eeb-cbc40e321101&amp;hub=sightings">log in and do it yourself</a>)</li>
<li>No students can appear in the images if they can be recognised (hands holding (safely!) or pointing to something is fine)</li>
<li>The teacher&#8217;s name and school name must be attached to the image (use the Attribution and Notes sections when you’re adding the image on <a href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/bioActivity/create/e61eb018-02a9-4e3b-a4b3-9d6be33d9cbb;jsessionid=7DD89A4BD325043BF4718F3984CA4802?returnTo=%2Fsightings%2FbioActivity%2FprojectRecords%2Ff813c99c-1a1d-4096-8eeb-cbc40e321101&amp;hub=sightings">Record your sighting</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our School Biodiversity Image Competition will be running alongside our popular Australian species &#8216;Image per day&#8217; Facebook promotion during National Science Week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former teacher and CSIRO’s Indigenous STEM Program Coordinator Geoff Guymer has a wealth of experience teaching in classrooms across Australia and loves using the ALA. This article outlines how he used the ALA in a Year 8 classroom, in Victoria, to help teach classification.</p>
<p>Using his experience working in remote communities in the Northern Territory, Geoff gave the classification activity a local Indigenous focus. This way, the activity fulfilled curriculum requirements for both science and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures cross curriculum priority – and made it more interesting for students.</p>
<p>Firstly, to learn about binomial classification, the students were asked to use the ALA to investigate, and identify to species level, at least 12 different plants in the school yard. They took a number of images and some plant samples were pressed and presented like authentic herbarium specimens.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_39181" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39181" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ALA-in-classroom-2-image-1-279x300.png" alt="" width="400" height="430" class="wp-image-39181 " /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39181" class="wp-caption-text">Some of the plant specimen images collected by the students</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>With the guidance of Boonwurrung Elder, Auntie Fay Stewart-Muir, and researching the ALA and other online resources*, the students found local Indigenous names and traditional uses for many of the plants that they identified, as well as other plants that are indigenous to the area. They learned which of the trees in the school yard would be best for carving boomerangs and the useful properties of some grass species. They also learned that some flowers that grew nearby were used to make sweet drinks.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_39182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39182" style="width: 684px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ALA-in-classroom-2-image-2-300x114.png" alt="" width="684" height="260" class="wp-image-39182" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39182" class="wp-caption-text">Part of a table used by the students while completing the activity</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>For the final part of the activity, students learned about dichotomous keys, then constructed one to organise the 12 plants they identified. They took their dichotomous key to other classes to see if it could be followed to identify the plants successfully.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_39183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39183" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ALA-in-classroom-2-image-3-300x233.png" alt="" width="554" height="430" class="wp-image-39183" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39183" class="wp-caption-text">One of the dichotomous keys made by the Year 8 students</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>“This was an excellent activity to run in the classroom. The students learned a lot about how to describe various characteristics of the plant such as leaf shape and leaf arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Knowing the difference between simple and compound leaves is important to know when following keys that taxonomists use when identifying plants. They also learned that it is important to use characteristics other than flowers for identification,” said Geoff.</p>
<p>Another ALA classroom activity developed by Geoff is outlined in <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/using-the-ala-in-the-classroom-to-celebrate-traditional-knowledge-and-culture/">Using the ALA in the classroom to celebrate traditional knowledge and culture</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former teacher and CSIRO’s Indigenous STEM Program Coordinator Geoff Guymer has a wealth of experience teaching in classrooms across Australia and loves using the ALA.</p>
<p>When Geoff was teaching Science and Mathematics at a high school in Altona in Victoria, he frequently used the ALA in the classroom. One example is a game he developed for the students to play as part of the school’s annual celebration of Indigenous culture.</p>
<p>This game can be easily adapted for any classroom, anywhere in Australia. In this particular instance, the game was named after the traditional people and custodians of the land that encompasses Altona.</p>
<p>To develop the game, Geoff and his students used the ALA’s <a href="http://biocache.ala.org.au/explore/your-area;jsessionid=EEC86A9EE7CDC4823708629424D4B209#-27.6|141|12|ALL_SPECIES">Explore your area</a> feature to find out which native animals and plants had been recorded around their school. Then, with a local elder, the group chose a number of species that had cultural significance and learned the Indigenous names for those species.</p>
<p>Next, they made game cards for each species. Game cards consisted of an image of the animal or plant, its common, scientific and local Indigenous name, and additional Indigenous knowledge and cultural information about the species. The students researched all this information using the <a href="http://lists.ala.org.au/iconic-species?fq=kvp+group%3ABirds">ALA species pages</a> and other sources.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_39015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39015" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39015 " src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BoonwurrungGo2-300x210.png" alt="" width="371" height="260" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39015" class="wp-caption-text">Game card for the Crow</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_39014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39014" style="width: 315px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39014 " src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BoonwurrungGo1-300x215.png" alt="" width="315" height="226" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39014" class="wp-caption-text">Game card for the Australian Blackwood</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Geoff then placed numbers on a map of the school grounds and placed one game card at the location of each number. To play the game, students ran around the schoolyard, following the map to each of the numbers to find the game cards. They filled out a worksheet with the information on each game card.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_39016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39016" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39016 " src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BoonwurrungGo3-300x213.png" alt="" width="324" height="230" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39016" class="wp-caption-text">Geoff created a map of the school yard with numbers indicating the location of each game card.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_39017" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39017" style="width: 368px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39017 " src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BoonwurrungGo4-300x211.png" alt="" width="368" height="259" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39017" class="wp-caption-text">Students completed a worksheet with information from the game cards they found in the school yard.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>While initially designed for his school’s Indigenous culture day, Geoff realised that participating in this type of activity addresses a number of requirements of the Australian Curriculum at various year levels.</p>
<p>“The ALA can help fulfil many areas of the science curriculum such as Classification and Adaptations, but it can also help illustrate maths and spatial reasoning and is excellent for incorporating the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures Cross-Curriculum Priority,” Geoff said.</p>
<p>Further case studies will outline some other examples of Geoff’s work using the ALA in the classroom.</p>
<p>Note: All Boonwurrung language references were given to Geoff Guymer, CSIRO, by Auntie Fay Stewart-Muir, Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages to be used as educational tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">School is back for students around the country this week, but in many cases the teachers have been hard at work over the school holidays.  Earlier this month, 70 teachers with a passion for Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) came together to participate in the STEM X Academy to further develop their capability to deliver quality science education in the classroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) was proud to be part of the STEM X Academy and ran a hands-on workshop for teachers to find out how they can incorporate the ALA in the classroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The STEM X Academy is a five-day residential teacher professional learning program open to Australian teachers across all sectors and levels of experience. Held in Canberra from 8-13 January, the event was a partnership between the <a href="http://asta.edu.au/">Australian Science Teachers Association</a> (ASTA), <a href="https://www.questacon.edu.au/">Questacon</a> and <a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_37536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37536" style="width: 533px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-37536" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2017/01/stemxblogpic-1.jpg" alt="Teachers from the STEM X Academy use the ALA to identify what they caught in their traps" width="533" height="294" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2017/01/stemxblogpic-1.jpg 820w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2017/01/stemxblogpic-1-300x165.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2017/01/stemxblogpic-1-768x423.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-37536" class="wp-caption-text">Teachers from the STEM X Academy use the ALA to identify what they caught in the traps they designed</figcaption></figure></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The main focus of the program was the development of hands-on, enquiry-based lessons and activities using available materials, and adapting activities using methods to suit individual classrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a part of the busy program, teachers split into groups with educators and research scientists and worked on developing potential solutions to future global challenges using STEM. The ALA presentation was one of a number of skillset workshops provided to potentially assist the teachers with completing the tasks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A couple of participants were even lucky enough to have a tour of CSIRO’s Australian National Insect Collection, guided by <a href="http://people.csiro.au/L/B/Bryan-Lessard">Bryan Lessard</a> also known as (aka) Bry the Fly Guy.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_37537" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37537" style="width: 317px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-37537" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2017/01/stemxblogpic2-1.jpg" alt="Brian Lessard shows teachers through the Australian National Insect Collection" width="317" height="352" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2017/01/stemxblogpic2-1.jpg 441w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2017/01/stemxblogpic2-1-271x300.jpg 271w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-37537" class="wp-caption-text">Brian Lessard shows teachers through the Australian National Insect Collection</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atlas of Living Australia website has been operating since 2010 and provides free, online access to a vast repository of information about Australia&#8217;s biodiversity. It supports research, environmental monitoring, conservation planning, biosecurity activities, education, citizen science, and the digitisation of millions of existing physical records around the country. The Atlas has over 54 million records on approximately 110,566 Australian species (as at May 2015 and growing rapidly), these records can be investigated through individual species profiles containing photos and collections data, and by using the mapping and analysis tools developed by the Atlas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_34180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34180" style="width: 815px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Magpie-Map-on-ALA.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-34180" src="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Magpie-Map-on-ALA.png" alt="Fun Fact: the Australian Magpie is the most recorded species in the Atlas, with over 670,000 records - from sightings in the wild to preserved specimens." width="815" height="560" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-34180" class="wp-caption-text">Fun Fact: the Australian Magpie is the most recorded species in the Atlas, with over 670,000 records &#8211; from sightings in the wild to preserved specimens.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atlas of Living Australia would like to discover more about how the Atlas assists users to gain further information on Australian species and how the Atlas can improve for the future. An online survey has been developed to gain further insight into how you use the Atlas and an opportunity for you to provide the Atlas with some important feedback. No matter how much or how little you use the Atlas of Living Australia, we would like to hear from you &#8211; as an added incentive, you could win a fantastic Atlas of Living Australia prize pack, including your very own cap, t-shirt, and coffee mug!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
