					<description><![CDATA[Australia participated in the iNaturalist City Nature Challenge for the first time in 2020, and iNaturalist Australia has reached 1 million observations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>City Nature Challenge 2020 – Australia</strong></p>



<p>iNaturalist has been hosting the City Nature Challenge around the world for 5 years. This year is special for us because it was the first time that Australians participated. Challenges ran from April 24-27 in four cities – Greater Adelaide, Geelong, Sydney and Redlands in Queensland, joining cities in this global initiative to celebrate nature in and around urban areas.</p>



<p>The challenge was to document as many species as possible in one weekend. This year was quite different for everybody due to COVID-19 restrictions, and organisers urged participants to carefully follow public health guidelines issued by their local authorities.</p>



<p>Together Australia&#8217;s teams contributed a total of 24,39 observations for 4,596 different species.</p>

<p>With many participants observing nature in their backyard, the City Nature Challenge proved to be an excellent way to safely connect with nature and each other while complying with social distancing measures.</p>



<p>‘’Considering the restrictions, the organisers were surprised by the level of engagement including the number of new users. The organisers are enthusiastic about engaging the community to gather and share biodiversity as this has great potential as a tool for biodiversity management in addition to research. While it’s a great way for citizen scientists to improve their knowledge of local biodiversity, ’ said Stephen Fricker, coordinator of the Greater Adelaide City Nature Challenge.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" width="207" height="126" src=""><strong>Major milestone: iNaturalist Australia hits 1 million observations</strong></p>



<p>Six months after the launch of iNaturalist Australia, we hit 1 million observations in mid-April. Thank you to all our keen Australian citizen scientists for uploading observations and the expert identifiers for verifying sightings.</p>



<p>iNaturalist Australia is proving to be a popular platform for insect and plant observations. From the recent City Nature Challenge results we can see that 28% of observations were insects and 42% plants. </p>



<p>The global iNaturalist network is one of the most successful citizen science platforms in the world, with instances in 10 different countries. The iNaturalist Australia community is very active with over 18,000 observers and over 8,000 identifiers</p>



<p><strong>New look for iNaturalist Australia</strong></p>



<p>The global iNaturalist brand has recently had a refresh and iNaturalist Australia has joined in too. The iNaturalist Australia logo now looks like this – so keep an eye out for bright green bird!</p>

<p><strong>iNaturalist and the ALA</strong></p>



<p>Collaborating with iNaturalist is a wonderful opportunity for the Atlas of Living Australia and our users.&nbsp;It provides an easy-to-use desktop and mobile platform, support for species identification, and tools for assessing data quality. All iNaturalist Australia data is regularly fed into the ALA.</p>



<p>Human observation data – individual sightings of species – are a valuable part of the ALA. This data helps to create a more detailed picture of our national biodiversity, and assists scientists and decision makers to deliver better outcomes for the environment and our species. iNaturalist Australia’s species identification features and data quality measures ensure individual sightings are more valuable than ever.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CSIRO and the University of Leeds are calling on people to play a short online game that will help investigate mimicry among velvet ant species. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p><strong>A curious kind of wasp</strong></p>



<p>Velvet ants (Mutillidae) are wasps that parasitise bees, carefully invading their nests and targeting their larvae by laying their eggs on or in this unsuspecting fresh food source. Unlike other parasitoid stinging wasps, velvet ants do not use their sting to paralyse their prey, but to protect themselves against predators or fight their way into bee nests.</p>



<p>Female velvet ants are wingless and covered with often
brightly-coloured hairs, giving them the appearance of velvety-soft ants. This
belies their sting, which is one of the most painful in the world. </p>



<p><strong>Mimicry in velvet ants</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website-1024x804.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-43866" width="409" height="320" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website-1024x804.jpg 1024w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website-300x236.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website-768x603.jpg 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website.jpg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></figure></div>



<p>Many velvet ant species are müllerian mimics. This is
a type of mimicry where species evolve matching colours and patterns to warn
predators that they share a harmful or unpalatable defence. It differs from Batesian
mimicry, where a harmless species mimics a harmful one, such as a hover fly
evolving the striped pattern of a bee. </p>



<p>Around the world, velvet ants are known to form müllerian
mimicry rings (groups of unrelated species that look similar and occupy the
same area) with other species of velvet ants and wasps.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website2-1024x714.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-43867" width="408" height="284" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website2-1024x714.jpg 1024w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website2-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website2-768x535.jpg 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/04/Velvet-ant-website2.jpg 1060w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /><figcaption>Images of Velvet ants (Mutillidae) in the Australian National Insect Collection.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“We are investigating the spatial patterns that result
from the evolution of müllerian mimicry in velvet ants,” says Dr Juanita Rodriguez,
a hymenopterist at the Australian National Insect Collection.</p>



<p>“Due to their very painful sting, velvet ants are
ideal for studying the evolution of müllerian mimicry,” she says. “This strong,
painful signal accompanied by a warning colouration teaches predators to keep
away. Having a certain
colour pattern provides an evolutionary advantage to velvet ants, keeping them
safer from predators.”</p>



<p>Some very interesting discoveries have been made by
studying mimicry. For example, humans may be driving mimicry patterns in weeds
that have evolved to look like crops and survive weeding. Other recent studies
show that climate change may be driving mimicry patterns in some insects. </p>



<p><strong>Calling citizen scientists to help expand our knowledge of mimicry in velvet ants</strong></p>



<p>The Australian National Insect Collection has developed an online game for citizen scientists to play. In this mimicry game, players take on the role of a predator, such as an insectivorous bird. </p>



<p>As a predator, what would factor in when deciding whether or not to feed on an insect? The game should take less than 15 minutes to play. </p>



<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>



<ol><li>Go to  <a href="http://www.comparevelvetants.com/">http://www.comparevelvetants.com/</a> </li><li>Look at the images and rate &#8211; on a scale from 0 to 10 &#8211; the similarity of one insect (on the left) to a group of insects (on the right). </li><li>Click Next, to move to the next set of images.</li><li>Images will continue to appear as long as you keep rating so feel free to stop at any time. </li><li>To stop, close your browser window.  </li></ol>



<p>This study builds on previous work by CSIRO’s digitisation team and citizen scientists to image more than 5000 velvet ant specimens in the <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Collections/ANIC">Australian National Insect Collection</a> and transcribe the label data for each specimen using <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/institution/index/5500680">DigiVol</a>.  </p>



<p><strong>The results</strong></p>



<p>“Our study will help expand our breadth of knowledge
on the occurrence of mimicry complexes in nature and will provide insights on
the evolution of mimicry in these charismatic insects,” Juanita says.</p>



<p>When the study is over, the results will also be
published in scientific papers, public reports, conference presentations and
online. </p>



<p>If you’re not already an expert entomologist and can
spare 15 minutes, play the mimicry game! <a href="http://www.comparevelvetants.com/">http://www.comparevelvetants.com/</a> </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The 2019-20 bushfire season has been a historically significant and unprecedented season, wreaking destruction on a massive scale and impacting biodiversity, air, water and built environments, as well as having economic, social and psychological effects on Australia’s population.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In response to the bushfires impacting Australia, Minister Karen Andrews, Minister for Industry, Science and Technology&nbsp;recently&nbsp;convened a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/karenandrews/media-releases/ministerial-statement-bushfire-science-roundtable" target="_blank">roundtable</a>&nbsp;of scientists and experts to&nbsp;frame&nbsp;a science-led&nbsp;response.&nbsp;One outcome of this roundtable&nbsp;was the recognition that considerable energy and capability exists in the citizen science community, providing a complimentary resource to&nbsp;research-led responses.&nbsp;CSIRO was asked to lead a process to identify&nbsp;opportunities for the public to engage in citizen science projects, and to maximise the likelihood of these activities delivering science-ready data.</p>



<h3 id="citizen-science-bushfire-forum">Citizen Science Bushfire Forum</h3>



<p>On February 14<sup>th</sup>, the ALA and CSIRO hosted a
national Citizen Science Bushfire Forum, bringing together many key national
partners and interested stakeholders across multiple sectors including research,
state and commonwealth government, non-government organisations, industry and
citizen science. these groups to begin discussions. </p>



<p>The objectives of this forum included the sharing of ideas for how science and citizen science sectors could work together in cohesion around a common goal, and to identify actions that could be taken immediately to support the sector through the current bushfire response and recovery phase. The scope of the forum was not limited to ecological biodiversity, but also included air, water, and the built environment.  </p>



<p>The group discussed the ability to collate resources through common approaches and the need to ensure that all relevant data becomes available in Australia’s national databases such as the ALA, enabling effective landscape scale responses.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1959-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Participants of the Citizen Science Stakeholder Forum gathered around a large conference table with laptops open." class="wp-image-43730" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1959-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1959-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1959-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1959-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1959-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1959-1-1920x1440.jpg 1920w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1959-1-640x480.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 id="identifying-bushfire-recovery-related-projects">Identifying bushfire recovery related projects</h3>



<p>We have created a specific category for bushfire recovery
related projects, and when tagged, they will appear when searched under the <em>bushfire
recovery projects</em> filter on the <a href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/acsa#isCitizenScience%3Dtrue%26isWorldWide%3Dfalse%26max%3D20%26sort%3DdateCreatedSort">Citizen Science Project Finder</a>. </p>



<p>If you are planning on creating a new bushfire related citizen science project, we encourage you to register your projects into the Citizen Science Project Finder, ensuring you identify the project as a <strong><em>bushfire recovery/monitoring </em></strong>project<strong><em>. </em></strong>If you have already registered your project, simply edit the project to indicate that it is bushfire recovery/monitoring related. By indicating your project is bushfire recovery related, it will display when the bushfire recovery projects filter is enabled, making the project easy to discover, access and for people to join. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="476" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/Project-finder-2-1024x476.png" alt="Australian Citizen Science's Project Finder homescreen, with the 'bushfire recovery projects' filter highlighted in orange." class="wp-image-43763" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/Project-finder-2-1024x476.png 1024w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/Project-finder-2-300x140.png 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/Project-finder-2-768x357.png 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/Project-finder-2-1536x714.png 1536w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/Project-finder-2.png 1722w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The &#8216;bushfire recovery projects&#8217; tag is now available on the Australian Citizen Science Project Finder.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">There are already several bushfire related projects using this filter, such as the <a href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/bushfire_recovery/project/index/4bf71a08-a8f7-4b2b-b0e8-9c54afa5c5b1">Environment Recovery Project &#8211; Australian Bushfires 2019-2020</a>.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the Australian Citizen Science Association Bushfire Working Group has developed a set of criteria that will be applied to all tagged projects to ensure they are producing data that is publicly accessible, shared into data aggregation depositories such as the ALA, compatible with other data sets, and appropriate to landscape scale assessment, monitoring and response.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks we will be calling on the public and the citizen science community to contribute to the existing projects or continue to create their own with guidance from researchers.</p>

<p>During the Ecological Society of Australia conference
delegates and the Launceston community are being invited to contribute to
science and environmental decision making by participating in a BioBlitz. </p>



<p>Whilst ecologists discuss how best to manage our
landscapes, they’re calling on locals to download the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/who-we-are-3/downloadable-tools/ala-mobile-app/">iNaturalist app</a> and upload all the
nature they see between 25 and 29 November into the <a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/projects/esaus19-bioblitz">ESAus19 BioBlitz</a>.</p>



<p>“The aim is to collect as many plant, animal, and
fungi observations as possible around Launceston and surrounds in the week of
the conference to get a snapshot of the environment,” says Peggy Newman from
the Atlas of Living Australia. </p>



<p>“The observations will be uploaded to the Atlas of
Living Australia which is used by governments, researchers, consultants and
land managers when they make decisions about the future for our native species,
for example whether to fund recovery plans for threatened species, or approve a
development applications.” </p>

<p>One researcher attending the Conference has put to
call out to Tasmanians to help him find Honeyeaters around Hobart, but would be
most interested in any sightings of these birds in Launceston. </p>



<p>“This threatened group of
woodland birds nest in a very specific part of the landscape, so I need the
community’s help to find a collection of local species in one place and
interacting. This is usually a single flower tree in a park, so I need the help
of Tasmanians to tell me where your Honeyeaters are,” says Graham Fulton from
the University of Queensland. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia has teamed up with global iNaturalist encouraging
citizen scientists to use&nbsp;<a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/">iNaturalist
Australia</a>&nbsp;to
record sightings. They are also encouraging experts to help identify species. </p>



<p>Peggy Newman will be speaking at ESA2019 in Launceston about the launch
of <a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/">iNaturalist Australia</a>, the Australian
node of iNaturalist, the world’s leading global social biodiversity network.</p>

<h2 id="more-about-inaturalist-australia">More about iNaturalist Australia</h2>



<p><strong>Observe nature
and share your findings</strong></p>



<p>You can record observations with <a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/">iNaturalist Australia</a>&nbsp;on your
desktop and by using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/who-we-are-3/downloadable-tools/ala-mobile-app/">iNaturalist
app</a>&nbsp;on
your iPhone or Android device.&nbsp;Use iNaturalist Australia to help identify
what you see and keep a record of where and when you see it. It’s your own
nature diary.</p>



<p>All iNaturalist Australia observations are loaded into the ALA regularly.
All data in the ALA is accessible and usable for researchers and decision
makers to access for environmental and ecoscience research and analysis.</p>



<p><strong>Identify species
and help improve data quality</strong></p>



<p>iNaturalist supports a large community of experts and citizen scientists
around the world. Its species identification system relies on the expertise of
the community, so the more experts the better.</p>



<p>iNaturalist enables conversations between experts and there are taxa
experts from around the world contributing to crowd sourced identifications and
sharing expertise. So, if you know a moth from a butterfly and a huntsman from an
orb-weaver, join the iNaturalist community and share your expertise. </p>



<p><strong>Why the ALA has teamed up with iNaturalist</strong></p>



<p>The ALA is Australia’s national biodiversity database and is keen to
improve the quality of human observation data entering the ALA. iNaturalist Australia
provides an easy-to-use desktop and mobile platform, support for species
identification, and tools for assessing data quality. All iNaturalist Australia
data is regularly fed into the ALA and you can link your ALA and iNaturalist
accounts to see all your records in one place.</p>



<p>Human observation data is a valuable part of the ALA. It helps to create
a more detailed picture of our national biodiversity and assists scientists and
decision makers to deliver better outcomes for the environment and our species.
iNaturalist Australia’s species identification features and data quality
measures will ensure your plant, animal or fungi sightings are more valuable
than ever.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/06/bowerbird-full-logo-1-300x74.png" alt="" width="243" height="60" class="alignright  wp-image-40615">Back in 2007 &#8211; when Bowerbird.org.au hatched &#8211; if you found an unusual looking creature in your backyard and wanted to know what it was, your best bet was to take it to your closest natural history museum, find an expert and ask them directly. It’s this type of interaction that Dr Ken Walker from Museums Victoria valued, and that inspired him.</p>
<p>Ken saw an opportunity in harnessing the enthusiasm and expertise of citizen scientists to build an online digital community for people to share images of backyard inhabitants and request species identification. This was the beginning of BowerBird.</p>
<p>“My favourite expression is ‘show me what’s in your backyard’. I love hearing about what people see and where. Our community of citizens and experts has uncovered some great secrets of the natural world,” Ken said.</p>

<p>BowerBird – and other websites such as the global platform iNaturalist – allow new discoveries to be made and shared with the world. They have also shown how members of the public can make significant contributions to our biodiversity knowledge.</p>
<p>“Citizen science is now a well-accepted and valued part of natural sciences. BowerBird and its contributors have helped to secure this status,“ Ken said.</p>

<p>As BowerBird closes, a collaborative rescue operation has been set in motion. A few active BowerBird volunteer heroes and iNaturalist staff have been busy helping almost 50 BowerBird users transfer more than half of all BowerBird records over to iNaturalist. The ALA will pick up the remainder of the records which cannot move across to an active <span>iNaturalist </span>user.</p>
<p>This is a great achievement and is an excellent celebration of BowerBird’s success. You can now see <span><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&amp;subview=grid&amp;verifiable=any&amp;field:Bowerbird%20URL=">52,652 observations BowerBird records on iNaturalist</a></span>.</p>
<p>The same ‘rescue team’ has set up a BowerBird project within iNaturalist, to ensure that the BowerBird community will be able to continue to grow and interact with each other. Access the <span><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/bowerbird">Bowerbird Project on iNaturalist</a></span>.</p>
<p>“The time has come to close BowerBird, but we should all be very proud of the legacy that BowerBird contributors have built and the many lessons that citizen science has learnt from BowerBird. I do hope BowerBird users will continue to make valuable contributions to science about our natural world through iNaturalist,” Ken said.</p>

<p><strong>Spider discovered by young citizen scientists<br />
</strong>Students from a school in Victoria discovered a small jumping spider during a Bug Blitz field day, and we (Museums Victoria experts) verified the spider&#8217;s identification and confirmed it had never been seen in Victoria before. The kids were thrilled and so were we! <span><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-29/rare-spider-discovered-by-young-citizen-scientists-verified/8662500">Read full article</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Bee and spider bedfellows in ‘world-first’ uncovered by citizen scientist<br />
</strong>Keen amateur photographer Laurence Sanders was walking through the botanical gardens in Emerald, Queensland, to take some pictures of jumping spiders when he spotted something a little odd. Laurence took a series of photos capturing a wolf spider sharing its burrow with a leafcutter bee. He posted the images on BowerBird and it created a real buzz. After checking with experts across the world, I confirmed this was a world-first. This species interaction had never been recorded before.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/the-odd-couple-keen-eye-spies-bee-and-spider-bedfellows-in-world-first-20180125-p4yywi.html">Read full article</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Deciding what to tree to plant? Just ask the butterflies.<br />
</strong>A group of people associated with a nature reserve somewhere on the Mornington Peninsula, wanted to replant the park with plants species about in the 1950s. So, they looked up the Butterfly dataset on Bioinformatics (the precursor to Bowerbird). They used the map grid query system, which also allowed users to select either a month or decade to query. This allowed them to ask: ‘What species of butterflies occurred in the Mornington Peninsula in the 1950s?’ From the results, they found food plant data per species, and began to compile a species planting guide for their nature reserve. The result was a list of plants that were eaten by butterfly caterpillars recorded in their area in the 1950s. I was stunned when they thanked me for providing such a dataset and explained how they had used the data.</p>

<p><strong>Australian Native Bees<br />
</strong>What I loved about BowerBird was that anyone could create a project and when other people joined that project and contributed image records, then a critical mass of data was built. My own project was Australian Native bees which started out with just me, but now has 524 people who have contributed over 4,000 image records from around Australia.<strong></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some ALA users will be familiar with iNaturalist, the global online community for naturalists. By becoming a member of the iNaturalist Network, the ALA will have its own local node called <strong>iNaturalist Australia</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, we’ll be working with iNaturalist to implement iNaturalist Australia. Already, all data collected and shared with iNaturalist can be viewed in the ALA. The collaboration will focus on using the iNaturalist platform for individual sightings in the ALA, leading to better species identification and data quality, as well as providing access to the largest biodiversity-loving community on the planet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/04/iNaturalist-how-it-works-1-300x115.png" alt="" width="835" height="322" class=" wp-image-40459 aligncenter" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/04/iNaturalist-how-it-works-1-300x115.png 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/04/iNaturalist-how-it-works-1-768x295.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px" /></p>
<h2 id="the-inaturalist-community"><strong>The iNaturalist community</strong></h2>
<p>iNaturalist is a great platform for supporting discussions and discoveries about species. Fundamentally, iNaturalist is a species occurrence recording tool and a crowdsourced species identification system. Its main goals are to connect people to nature, to enhance understanding of life on Earth and encourage people to value it. iNaturalist does this by generating scientifically credible biodiversity data from personal encounters with the natural world.</p>
<p>There are two types of users in iNaturalist:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observers:</strong> are people who are keen to document and record the biodiversity around them using photos or sounds.</li>
<li><strong>Identifiers: </strong>are people willing to put on their taxonomist’s hat and improve the quality of the records by agreeing or disagreeing on the suggested species. Many identifiers are experts in their field, but they can also be citizen scientists who have an interest in taxonomy. Identifiers underpin the iNaturalist identification system.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-the-ala-inaturalist-collaboration-for-ala-users"><strong>Benefits of the ALA–iNaturalist collaboration for ALA users</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Improved Species identification</strong></p>
<p>One of the most frequent questions from citizen scientists to our ALA support team is about species identification. Up to now, we’ve only been able to advise users how to seek out species identification for themselves e.g. contact their closest natural history museum or herbarium.</p>
<p>iNaturalist provides access to a larger network of species identifiers – citizen scientists and biologists who identify and verify sightings. This will improve the quality of individual human observation data in the ALA. In turn, this means, individual human observation data will have greater benefit to biodiversity science.</p>
<p>iNaturalist is also a world leader in using machine learning to identify species in an image, this helps speed up the identification process. At the moment it takes an average of 18 days for the community to identify a species, but over half are completed within 2 days.</p>
<p><strong>Improved data quality</strong></p>
<p>As a repository of data from a large number of different data providers, the ALA is continually working on improving the quality of data and improving tools to filter and analyse data.&nbsp; By using crowdsourced identifications, iNaturalist Australia will improve the quality of individual human observations in the ALA. And better data quality means improved outcomes for biodiversity science.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Intergenerational traditional ecological knowledge transfer and Citizen Science]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>by Yugul Mangi Rangers, Ben Kitchener, Dr. Emilie Ens</strong></p>
<p>Since colonisation, the coerced centralisation of Aboriginal groups meant that many Aboriginal people were disconnected from their Country. Across Australia there are concerted efforts by Indigenous communities to get back and reconnect to Country. Many things have changed over the last 200 plus years such as native species decline, invasion of new species and changed fire regimes. Our cross-cultural Citizen Science project aims to learn about these changes using Western and Indigenous techniques and include Rangers, Elders and young people to inform current and future land management decision-making.</p>
<p>In September 2018, the Yugul Mangi Rangers of south east Arnhem land and Macquarie University scientists planned a cross-cultural fauna survey for the Wilton River Range, approximately 20 minutes drive from Ngukurr Aboriginal community. This area was chosen as it holds special cultural value to local people. Additionally, Elders recalled the presence of many native mammal species here in the past, such as the critically endangered Northern Quoll and various rodent species, which have not been seen in recent times.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_40536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40536" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/05/Wilton-River-Survey-Location-IEK-May-2019-1-1-300x124.png" alt="" width="605" height="250" class=" wp-image-40536"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40536" class="wp-caption-text">The Wilton River survey location (green diamond) in the South East Arnhem Land Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) (yellow polygon) in the Top End region of Australia.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As part of the trip, the survey team partnered with Ngukurr School and took 33 students on the survey with the hope of finding some interesting animal species and teaching students about the value of cross-cultural research. The Year 7 and Year 8-9 classes assisted rangers on the second day of the survey to check, rebait and set animal traps and do a spotlighting survey. Additionally, the senior boys class participated in an overnight trip and assisted with trap checking and maintenance, a spotlighting survey, Indigenous traditional animal surveys (including active searches and fishing surveys) and finally helped pack up the survey sites on the final day.</p>
<p>These activities were led by Yugul Mangi Rangers Clayton Munur, Gene Daniels, Patrick Daniels and Cedrick Robertson. The rangers taught the students about: the use of both western and Indigenous animal trapping techniques; the use of technology for data collection (survey app and tablet); and modern threats to local fauna, such as the Cane Toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>).</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_40539" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40539" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/05/IEK-may-2019-left-and-right-students-1-300x119.png" alt="" width="580" height="230" class=" wp-image-40539"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40539" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Left</strong>: A Ngukurr School student is assisted by rangers as he checks a funnel trap for any captured skinks or geckos. <strong>Right</strong>: Students use the survey app to record species data, with the assistance of Macquarie’s Ben Kitchener.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Overall, the survey team recorded 57 fauna species throughout the survey period. Interesting species included the Orange-naped Snake (<em>Furina ornata</em>), Sugar Glider (<em>Petaurus breviceps</em>), Delicate Mouse (<em>Pseudomys delicatulus</em>), Spiny-tailed Gecko (<em>Strophurus ciliaris</em>) and Metallic Snake-eyed Skink (<em>Cryptoblepharus metallicus</em>).</p>
<p>The team also made some valuable cultural knowledge recordings, as we were lucky enough to have local Urapunga Elder, Dennis Duncan, joining us to speak to the students about the history of the survey area. The location surveyed was Dennis’s country where he grew up with his family, and also holds great cultural significance as a men’s ceremonial area. However, with the building of the Roper Highway, which runs through this country, these ceremonies have been forced to relocate to a different area.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_40540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40540" style="width: 525px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/05/IEK-amy-2019-Urapunga-Elder-and-Trad-Owner-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="393" class=" wp-image-40540"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40540" class="wp-caption-text">Urapunga Elder and Traditional Owner, Dennis Duncan, tells Ngukurr School students about stories of the country being surveyed and the cultural importance of the area to his family and the local people.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The outcomes of this survey, both social and ecological, demonstrate the value of a cross-cultural approach to citizen science in remote communities. Collaboration with schools and other youth groups provides rangers and community Elders with a platform for the intergenerational transfer of cultural knowledge and the engagement of youth in on-country conservation.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_40541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40541" style="width: 533px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2019/05/IEK-may-2019_survey-team-1-300x225.png" alt="" width="533" height="399" class=" wp-image-40541"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40541" class="wp-caption-text">Some of the survey team, including students, rangers and community members pose for a group photo at the rocky survey site.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><em>Special thanks to the Ngukurr and Urapunga communities, and particularly Urapunga Elder Dennis Duncan for sharing a small part of his local knowledge and hosting the Yugul Mangi Rangers and Macquarie University staff on his country.</em></p>
