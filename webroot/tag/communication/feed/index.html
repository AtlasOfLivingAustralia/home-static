										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CSIRO’s new book, <em>Biodiversity: Science and Solutions for Australia</em>, is jam-packed with the latest scientific knowledge about Australia’s biodiversity, so of course the Atlas of Living Australia is a key feature.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/biodiversity-book/attachment/coverfinal/" rel="attachment wp-att-32454"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-32454 alignright" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Front cover of CSIRO's new book 'Biodiversity: Science and Solutions for Australia'" src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CoverFinal-188x238.png" alt="Front cover of CSIRO's new book 'Biodiversity: Science and Solutions for Australia'" width="188" height="238" /></a>The book, which is available free from <a href="http://www.csiro.au/biodiversitybook" target="_blank">www.csiro.au/biodiversitybook</a>, describes the ancient origins and unique features of Australia’s plants, animals and ecosystems, and looks at how they are currently tracking. It highlights indigenous perspectives on biodiversity and describes how Australia’s biodiversity interacts with agriculture, the resources sector, cities and with our changing global environment. The book also identifies practical solutions for managing Australia’s globally unique natural assets, including the invaluable role of the ALA.</p>
<p>A number of case studies throughout the book demonstrate the use of the ALA. One case study highlights how the ALA is being used to predict future trends in Australian biodiversity by providing information on the location and conservation status of Australia’s species. Others describe how the ALA is guiding revegetation under a changing climate, and how it is assisting in the design of Australia’s National Reserve System. Lastly, the ALA’s ‘Explore your area’ function provides a great example of how readers of the book can get to know the biodiversity in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The ALA is also a key part of the interactive eBook version of the book. Every species mentioned in the book links to the relevant species page on the ALA, greatly increasing the amount of information available to readers with a simple click on the screen. The eBook also contains links to videos with the book’s authors, animations, articles and further reading items.</p>
<p>For your free copy of the book, head to <a href="http://www.csiro.au/biodiversitybook" target="_blank">www.csiro.au/biodiversitybook</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">With the 2014 ALA Science Symposium now fading into memory I wanted to record a few thoughts about this year’s event.</span></p>
<p>The focus of the previous (2013) ALA Symposium was the achievements of the project and our wider partner community.  This year we shifted some of the focus to where we are going, what we are currently working on, and what you can expect to see soon.  There was still room for some reflection, with the panels providing a great opportunity for conversations as a group about where we want to head.</p>
<p>We had a full program, with many stimulating talks and a couple of chances for lively discussion. Copies of the presentations can be found <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><a title="2014 Symposium Presentations" href="http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/communications-centre/presentations/2014-symposium-presentations/">HERE</a>, </strong><span style="font-size: small;">and many thanks to the authors who have made them available.</span></span></p>
<p>We have had nothing but positive feedback on the symposium – and most particularly on the quality and enthusiasm of the various participants.  For me one of the main successes of the Symposium was seeing how the Atlas community is coming together and is excited about our shared future.  As stimulating as the presentations and discussions were, the sense of excitement I saw in the room during the breaks was even more impressive.  Everywhere there were lively discussions, interested people getting more information from presenters, and various networks being formed to develop and progress some of the emerging ideas.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who helped make the 2014 Atlas of Living Australia Science Symposium such a success.  This includes presenters, moderators, panellists, the Atlas staff who worked so hard at the organisation – but also all the participants who contributed through attending and creating such a lively atmosphere.  This high level of community engagement is compelling evidence of a strong future for the Atlas.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone at our next Symposium!</p>
<p>John La Salle</p>
