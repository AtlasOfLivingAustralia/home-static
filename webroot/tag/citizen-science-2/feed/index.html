										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">Citizen scientists help uncover the secrets of bird baths across Australia</p>
<p>Dr Gráinne Cleary from Deakin University’s School of Life and Environmental Sciences, recently published Australia’s largest ever study into the use of urban and rural bird baths in private gardens.</p>
<p>The study investigated bird baths in 13 different regions across Australia, from south-eastern Queensland to southern South Australia, and was made possible with the help of almost 1000 citizen scientists and the ALA’s data collection tools.</p>
<p>The study found that native birds such as Superb Fairy Wrens, Grey Fantails, Lewin’s and New Holland Honeyeaters were recorded more frequently at rural bird baths. Whereas introduced species such as Spotted Doves, Common Blackbirds and House Sparrows were seen more frequently at urban bird baths. Overall, the number of different species was greater in rural bird baths compared to urban ones.</p>
<p>This study also demonstrated the valuable contribution that citizen scientists can make to studies that require large amounts of data to be gathered across a large area.</p>
<p>After advertising through local media and Facebook and engaging with ornithological associations across Australia, a total of 992 citizen scientists contributed data to the study. Each person was required to observe their bird bath for 20 minutes, three times per week, for a total of eight weeks over summer 2014 and winter 2015. They then logged their sightings online through the ALA. Participants were given a field guide to help identify species and were also able to email photos and descriptions of birds to ensure correct identification.</p>
<p>The study was published in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150899">Avian Assemblages at Bird Baths: A Comparison of Urban and Rural Bird Baths in Australia</a> in Plos One, March 2016.</p>
<p>Since the <em>Bathing Birds</em> project was run, the ALA has updated it’s data collection tools making it easier for people to run their own projects.

<p>COG developed an exciting citizen science project, the Gang-gang survey, to enlist the help of the community to collect information about the Gang-gang cockatoo.  Mr Chris Davey, the survey project manager said COG was keen to introduce a wider audience to the fun of birdwatching and spark their interest in learning more about native birds and their habitat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reaching this audience was greatly enabled by the development of the on-line web portal for the survey by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)&#8221; Mr Davey said. Members of the public were able to register and log casual sightings of the Gang-gang in the database.  &#8220;It also helped that the Gang-gang is a charismatic bird, easily-recognised by its squeaky gate call and plumage&#8221; Mr Davey said.</p>
<p>The community response to the survey was outstanding with over 4,000 sightings logged in the ALA database and over 300 on-line participants by the end of the 12 month survey in February 2015. Ms Kathy Eyles, the survey communications manager said &#8220;Most of the survey participants were not COG members and we are excited that for many local people, this was their first foray into citizen science!&#8221;</p>
<p>Positive local media coverage of the survey project and also widespread affection and concern for the Gang-gang Cockatoo provided a focal point for community participation. Ms Eyles said there was plenty of positive feedback from participants. &#8220;We asked observers why they got involved in the survey and most said they were keen to help a project to learn more about the Gang-gang and really enjoyed watching out for these gorgeous birds in their gardens and local reserves&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted to get involved in citizen science &#8211; this is the first time I&#8217;ve been involved!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Survey made my walks more interesting and an interesting bird&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I feel I can help protect them by logging them in the survey&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Gang-gangs are interesting attractive birds and I&#8217;m worried about their decline&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Proud to see them in my garden&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_35914" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35914" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318174517/http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TeganListonIMG_2786ee-300x200.jpeg" alt="Gang-gang" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-35914" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35914" class="wp-caption-text">Gang-gang (image credit: Tegan Liston)</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;Importantly, we were also able to use the feedback from participants to identify a number of survey design and communication lessons for future citizen science projects&#8221; Ms Eyles said.</p>
<p>Mr Chris Davey the survey project manager said, the survey results reveal that the Gang-gang cockatoo has an interesting and non-random distribution within the region. &#8220;In urban Canberra for example, you are more likely to see the Gang-gang in suburbs bordering the forested nature reserves of Mt Majura and Mt Ainslie, Gossan Hill, Bruce and O’Connor Ridges, Black Mountain, Aranda Bushland to the north of Lake Burley Griffin and Red Hill and Mt Taylor to the south&#8221; Mr Davey said.</p>
<p>While the survey provided much needed information on the distribution and behaviour of Gang-gangs, it was not able to provide information on movement patterns that would help determine the number of Gang-gangs in the local region.</p>
<p>COG is now talking with the ANU Fenner School about a doctoral research project to build on the survey results. This research would track movement, possibly using marked birds, to shed light on their movement patterns in the region, and may also involve a breeding study. This means our budding citizen scientists may well be called upon again to help track the Gang-gang Cockatoo.</p>
<p>Copies of the survey reports are available from the Canberra Birds website: <a href="http://canberrabirds.org.au/observing-birds/gang-gang-survey/">http://canberrabirds.org.au/observing-birds/gang-gang-survey/</a></p>

<p>BioBlitzes bring scientists, naturalists, and public volunteers (Citizen Scientists) together to explore and record biodiversity information and learn about local ecological communities. This two day event will have a schools program on Friday and surveys will be happening from before dawn to after dark. Bioblitzes are a great way to be part of large-scale environmental studies within an enjoyable community atmosphere, all while gathering important regional data that can be used for research and giving an opportunity to learn about our natural environment alongside the experts.</p>

<p>The Wallagoot catchment is predominately forest or woodland with cleared land for agriculture, the Wallagoot Lake itself is an <a href="http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fisheries/habitat/aquatic-habitats/wetland/coastal-wetlands/management-of-coastal-lakes-and-lagoons-in-nsw#What-is-an-‘ICOLL’?" target="_blank">ICOLL</a> with seagrass beds and small areas of saltmarsh. There are large areas protected in the Bournda National Park and Bournda Nature Reserve as well as Bega Local Aboriginal Land Council land and property in private ownership.</p>
<p>Several endangered ecological communities and a number of threatened flora and fauna species as well as a number of invasive species can be found in the area. The Kalaru/Wallagoot area is rich in fauna values, especially for the Yellow-bellied Glider, Glossy Black Cockatoo, and threatened shore and water birds. The area is a wildlife corridor allowing species to move between more and less disturbed areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bie.ala.org.au/species/Phascolarctos+cinereus" target="_blank">Koala</a> is one of the most recognizable and celebrated species in Australian fauna, inhabiting Eucalyptus woodlands and forests through out eastern Australia: from the SE South Australia across Victoria, Eastern NSW, and SE QLD. Koalas are one of the few Australian species that feed exclusively on Eucalyptus leaves and are partial to only a few gum tree species (not a highly nutritious or energy rich diet, hence all the sleeping!). The iconic Koala is celebrated in popular culture and are on the must-see list for almost every international tourist visiting Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_35278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35278" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-35278" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/10/Celebs-Holding-Koalas-1.jpg" alt="T-Swizzle, Oprah, Obama, Camilla, Harry Styles, Putin, MJ, and Mariah...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Koala populations are being threatened by a number of factors including habitat loss (urban development, fire, and drought) and disease, including a highly infectious <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22207442" target="_blank">strain of </a><em><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22207442" target="_blank">Chlamydia</a>;</em> a sexually transmitted disease which can presents symptoms such as conjunctivitis and genital infections, causing individuals to be weak and vulnerable to other threats (predation, malnutrition, fire, etc.).</p>
<p>Across the Koala range of Australia; conservation groups, ecologists, wildlife organisations, national parks, and government departments are engaging in programs and methods to monitor, protect, and ensure Koalas continue to exist.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/get-involved/citizen-science/" target="_blank">Bioblitzes and Citizen Science projects</a> are a great way to get involved with Koala conservation and research, and the ALA supports a number of community projects which are happening RIGHT NOW! Below is a list of current and ongoing koala-focused projects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="koala-count-2015"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>KOALA COUNT 2015</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>National Parks Association of NSW</strong></p>
<p>Koala Count 2015 is large-scale, national citizen science survey developed by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216163604/http://npansw.org.au/index.php/campaigns/citizen-science/koala-count" target="_blank">National Parks Association of NSW</a> (NPA). The aim of the annual count is to build a comprehensive picture of koala numbers and locations across Australia. This year, they have have partnered with <a href="http://naturemapr.com/">NatureMapr</a> – an innovative public data collection software that brings together nature enthusiasts and conservation experts – to develop a new Koala Count app that makes data collection more robust and helps participants to record sightings more easily. The app is a free GPS enabled software that allows the user to upload sightings directly to the database. This data will then be uploaded to the Atlas of Living Australia.</p>
<p>Koala Count runs from 7-17 November 2015. For more information or to get involved, please visit: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516200533/http://koalacount.org.au/" target="_blank">http://koalacount.org.au/</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Investigating the decline of our native species</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/wildcount.htm" target="_blank">WildCount</a> project is an initiative from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage and National Parks and Wildlife Service and is a 10-year monitoring program that uses 300 motion-sensitive digital cameras across 146 National parks and reserves. It looks at trends around what animals are present at these sites and how many there are, to understand if native species are in decline, increasing in number or stable.</p>
<p>Since the WildCount program started in 2012, over 800,000 images have been collected. Each year between February and May the WildCount team go out into the bush and set up the motion sensing cameras. They set up a lure of peanut butter and honey in a tea ball to attract the animals and wait two weeks before retrieving the cameras to see what they have captured.</p>
<p>The only problem is that when the team are done with checking all the cameras, there will be around 280,000 images captured. This takes a small team of researchers and volunteers almost a whole year to process accurately. While about one third of all the images contain no animals, WildCount has captured some truly weird and wonderful animal interactions so far, like a pair of wallabies having a hug, a curious emu, a Lyre bird attacking a black snake and a wombat crossing paths with a spider.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVunfaniOLM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How can Citizen Scientists help? </strong></p>
<p>The WildCount team is now looking to Citizen Scientists to help sift through this vast volume of ‘animal selfies’ to see if they can process the data much faster whilst still maintain the scientific accuracy of the study.  If you know what a kangaroo, emu, echidna or possum looks like or the name of the bird on the Australian 10c piece you’ve got the skills to be a citizen scientist on the WildCount project.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34888" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z-1.jpg" alt="14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z-1.jpg 640w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Citizen Scientists will use <a href="http://www.digivol.org">DigiVol</a>, a website developed by the Australian Museum and the Atlas of Living Australia, to record information from each image such as the number of animals in the photograph and the name of the species. DigiVol has been primarily used for unlocking scientific data from the biodiversity collections of institutions in Australia and around the world including the Smithsonian, Kew Gardens, South Australian Museum, Museum Victoria, CSIRO’s Australian National Insect Collection, Harvard University and many more. Its innovative and flexible online platform provides institutions with an easy to use interface for hosting their own “virtual expeditions” and is perfect for hosting WildCount. More importantly DigiVol provides an interesting and fun way for citizen scientists to contribute to science.</p>
<p>After the images are processed the WildCount team and experts will verify the species identification and counts. They are currently with biostatisticians from industry and CSIRO to help them detect changes in the occurrence of several Australian small-medium mammal species such as the brush tail possum, rock wallaby, lyrebird, grey kangaroo and the common wombat over 10 years. This will help understand if there are changes occurring that meet the criteria for listing species under the IUCN Red List. The power to detect such changes means scientists have an early warning system to see what is happening to common native species as well as examine other trends such as increase in pest species like red foxes.</p>

<p>By helping to capture this information, the community would be helping scientists understand changes in native and pest species which will assist in the management of NSW&#8217;s precious biodiversity in National parks and reserves. It may also uncover a few weird and wonderful animal interactions or even prove the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_bear" target="_blank">Drop Bears</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyip" target="_blank">Bunyips</a> once and for all!</p>
<p>It is hoped that many Citizen Scientists will join DigiVol and not only help with WildCount but the many other worthwhile &#8220;virtual expeditions&#8221; on DigiVol. Over the past four years DigiVol has seen over 1000 volunteers capture data from more than 170,000 labels and field note pages from museums and collections.</p>
<p><strong>You can take part in the WildCount DigiVol expedition <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/7878939" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>The WildCount DigiVol expedition is a collaboration between the NSW  Office of Environment and Heritage, The Australian Museum  and the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). The data from this project will be processed via DigiVol and uploaded to the ALA website and the data archived and made available through NSW BioNet Wildlife Atlas.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed that the Atlas of Living Australia website has gone through a few changes in appearance over the past 6 months. We are currently upgrading our user interfaces to be consistent with our refreshed homepage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week the Atlas released a redesigned version of our <a href="http://sightings.ala.org.au/">Report a Sighting</a> page, which allows users to report on sightings of species and upload their images to the Atlas. The map functionality has been simplified and we&#8217;ve added a new tool called &#8220;location-based species suggestion tool&#8221; which provides thumbnail images of species that are known to occur in the user&#8217;s location. The page has also been optimised for use on mobile phones and tablets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian <a title="Citizen Scientists and the ALA" href="https://www.ala.org.au/get-involved/citizen-science/" target="_blank">Citizen Scientists</a> are busy (like bees!) documenting the spread of an exotic and invasive South African carder bee, <em>Afranthidium Immanthidium repetitum</em>. Through the great work of the <a title="Carder Bee Project" href="Hyperlink:%20http://www.bowerbird.org.au/projects/3426/sightings" target="_blank">BowerBird community</a>, the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a> has learnt that the known distribution for this species has increased significantly. From what was first recorded in Brisbane in 2000, Sydney in 2007, and recent records in Rockhampton and Albury lodged in late 2014.</p>
<figure id="attachment_33970" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33970" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-Yellow-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-33970" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-Yellow-1.jpg" alt="South African carder bee, Afranthidium Immanthidium repetitum Credit: Laurence Sanders" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-Yellow-1.jpg 800w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-Yellow-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-Yellow-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-Yellow-1-640x480.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-33970" class="wp-caption-text">South African carder bee,<em> Afranthidium Immanthidium repetitum</em> Credit: Laurence Sanders via BowerBird</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, Ken Walker from the Victoria Museum has now confirmed a new sighting for the species: in Victoria. The species has well and truly crossed the state borders, and human transportation is the most likely cause for its spread, as explained in this <a title="Carder Bee QLD Factsheet" href="http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Animals+of+Queensland/Insects/Wasps+and+bees/Common+species/Meter-box+Carder+Bee#.VRtsN_yUfpp" target="_blank">Queensland Museum fact sheet</a>.</p>

<p>The <a title="Bee record on BB" href="http://www.bowerbird.org.au/observations/29816" target="_blank">sighted bee</a> was captured, recorded, and uploaded by a member of the public to the <a title="BoweBird" href="http://www.bowerbird.org.au/" target="_blank">BowerBird</a> website for identification on December 8 2014, from the suburb of Kew in Victoria.</p>
<p>The initial image of the male specimen was taken in alcohol, looking down one eyepiece of a microscope with an iPhone – an impressive photograph and certainly good enough for species identification (as there is no native <a title="Megachilidae Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachilidae" target="_blank">megachilid</a> bee in Australia with these distinctive yellow colour markings). The photographed specimen is now in the collection of Museum Victoria.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike many other megachilid bee species, this bee does not nest in the ground or in wooden holes, but rather it makes a “cotton-ball like” free standing nest from “hairs” it gathers from plant leaves and forms its nest inside sheltered locations such as wooden boxes or window frames: making them a perfect candidate for human transportation.</p>
<p>Citizen Science is a very important source of data for Australian biodiversity knowledge. Data and insights gained through the efforts of everyday spotters can be as valuable as that obtained by scientists working in academia, natural history collections, government agencies and business. The new sightings of invasive pests uploaded by citizen scientists are a perfect example of how public knowledge and experiences with the environment around them can assist with issues of national importance, such as biosecurity.</p>
<p>BowerBird is supported by the Atlas of Living Australia and <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/" target="_blank">Museum Victoria</a>. Records provided to and identified by BowerBird users are uploaded to the Atlas of Living Australia each week.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">With summer almost here, now is the perfect time to get out of the house and enjoy Australia’s great outdoors. And what better way to do it than by joining one of the citizen science events that are happening across the country this November! Not only will you be out enjoying nature, but you’ll be making a valuable contribution to Australia’s biodiversity knowledge as well, with recorded sightings being fed into the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a>(ALA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Events include the <a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.alcw.org.au/mimosa-rocks-bioblitz-ready-to-roll/" target="_blank">Mimosa Rocks BioBlitz</a>, which is taking place on the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> of November; the <a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/research/bioblitz.htm" target="_blank">World Parks Congress BioBlitz</a>, which will be held in Sydney on Sunday November 16<sup>th</sup>; and the <a href="http://koalacount.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/npansw/home.htm" target="_blank">National Koala Count</a>, which will run from the 7<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th</sup> of November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The picturesque Mimosa Rocks National Park is located on the NSW south coast and is home to an amazing array of flora and fauna, including Potaroos, Glossy Black-cockatoos, orchids, and cycads to name just a few. The Mimosa Rocks BioBlitz will include 43 surveys hosted by expert scientists and naturalists. For more information, including what surveys are happening when and how to register, please visit <a href="http://www.alcw.org.au/mimosa-rocks-bioblitz-ready-to-roll/" target="_blank">www.alcw.org.au</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">The World Parks Congress (WPC) BioBlitz is happening as part of <a href="http://www.worldparkscongress.org/involved/social_planetfest.html" target="_blank">PlanetFest</a>, and, with the help of families and nature lovers, aims to capture a snapshot of the biodiversity at Sydney Olympic Park. Experts will take participants on guided nature surveys where they’ll go hunting for birds, insects, plants, frogs and water bugs. There will be hands on displays in the BioBlitz marquee, providing the opportunity to learn more about BioBlitz events and how they assist protected area managers to involve the public in scientific surveys. For more information and to register for the event, please visit <a href="http://wpcbioblitz.eventbrite.com.au" target="_blank">http://wpcbioblitz.eventbrite.com.au</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Both the Mimosa Rocks and WPC BioBlitz events are using the international product, <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>, to register sightings. These records will be incorporated into the ALA on a regular basis.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_32740" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32740" style="width: 316px" class="wp-caption alignright"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/calling-all-citizen-scientists/attachment/istock_000019042302xlarge_reduced/" rel="attachment wp-att-32740"><img class="size-medium wp-image-32740  " title="Two koalas sitting on a branch" src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/iStock_000019042302XLarge_REDUCED-316x210.jpg" alt="Two koalas sitting on a branch" width="316" height="210" /></a></span><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32740" class="wp-caption-text">Join the fun of the National Koala Count and help us better understand these furry friends.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And for those who aren’t in NSW, why not take part in the National Koala Count, which is open to participants across Australia. A freely-available, GPS-enabled smartphone app, BioTag, has been developed especially for the event by the ALA. The app allows participants to easily record their koala sightings anywhere across the country. BioTag is available for both android and Apple mobile devices and can be downloaded from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=biotag&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google play</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/itunes/" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, just search for BioTag. People who do not own a smartphone or tablet can enter their sightings directly into the <a href="http://koalacount.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/npansw/home.htm?signin=true" target="_blank">National Parks Association’s Data Portal</a>. To get involved, simply register at <a href="http://koalacount.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/npansw/home.htm" target="_blank">www.koalacount.org.au</a>, download BioTag, or log onto the <a href="http://koalacount.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/npansw/home.htm?signin=true" target="_blank">Data Portal</a>, and you are ready to start counting!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">By participating in any (or all!) of these events you will be helping to build a more comprehensive picture of the numbers and locations of Australian plant and animal species across the landscape, which is highly important for the effective management of our precious and unique biodiversity.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> is a collaboration between the <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/" target="_blank">Australian Museum</a> and the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a> that was initially an experimental foray into crowd-sourcing. At the time, the notion that there were online volunteers willing to help natural history collections capture their data seemed rather far-fetched.</p>
<figure style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " style="text-align: center; background-color: #f3f3f3;" src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AustMuseum-379x254-custom.jpg" alt="An Australian Museum staff member inspects a tray of shells." width="341" height="229" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Melissa Graf © Australian Museum</figcaption></figure>
<p>It was definitely a risk: crowd-sourcing was in its infancy and there were no other museums providing online volunteers with an opportunity to help digitise their natural history collections. But now, DigiVol has not only become a means for Australia’s museums to tackle the enormous task of digitising their collections, but institutions like the Smithsonian, New York Botanic Gardens, and Kew Gardens have also chosen DigiVol to host their own virtual expeditions to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>As further proof of DigiVol’s success, we recently recorded two impressive milestones. Our volunteers at <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol Online </a>have now completed over 100,000 transcription tasks, with some of our most prolific volunteers completing over 10,000 transcription tasks each. Also, in just two short years, <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/Rapid-Digitisation-Project" target="_blank">DigiVol Lab</a> volunteers at the Australian Museum have created over 70,000 images of the Museum’s very large Malacology (think molluscs, such as snails, slugs, clams, octopus and squid) collection. These milestones represent a monumental contribution to digitising the collections of museums and herbaria from Australia and around the world.</p>
