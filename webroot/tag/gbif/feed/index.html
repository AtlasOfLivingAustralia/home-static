										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reference collections in museums, herbaria, botanical gardens, zoos and other repositories are critical infrastructure for research, education, regulation and legislation related to biodiversity.  These collections provide documentation of research results as well as long-term changes in nature.  Patterns of ecological, evolutionary and anthropogenic changes often go unseen and undocumented until samples from these collections material are analyzed and re-analysed using the latest technology.</p>
<p>In order to be accessible and effective, reference collections need to be digitised and their data and metadata made available to the research and education community, to policy-makers, and to the general public.  Digitisation in the most general sense is the association of an organism and its characteristics to a unique identifier that can be indexed for later searching and retrieval.  It can take several forms, ranging from digital capture of label data (date and place of collection, taxonomic identification) to digital image capture and even DNA sequencing.</p>
<p>As part of the <strong><a href="http://www.psi2013.usp.ac.fj/">12th Pacific Science Association Inter-Congress</a>,</strong> being held from the <strong>08 – 12 July 2013 at the The University of the South Pacific, Laucala Campus, Suva, FIJI,</strong> a full day session is being offered which will include a half-day symposium of contributed presentations on DNA barcoding and a half-day instructional workshop on biodiversity informatics.  The DNA barcoding symposium will contribute toward development of a regional strategy for Oceania for  construction and use of standardised barcode libraries.  These libraries could serve basic research in ecology and evolution and/or applications such as the protection of endangered species and control of invasive alien species such as agricultural pests.</p>
<p>The biodiversity informatics workshop will showcase initiatives such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), New Zealand Organisms register (NZOR), and digitization initiatives such as iDigBio and Australia’s Virtual Herbarium (AVH).  This session will explore applications and network tools appropriate for the small and scattered countries and territories of Oceania. Participants will learn the latest approaches to the digitization of natural history collections and explore how these could be applied to their collections. The session will conclude with a round-table discussion on strategic development of, and support for, biodiversity informatics in the Oceania region.</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has expressed its support for this proposed workshop as a contribution to enhancing capacity in taxonomy (a goal of CBD&#8217;s Global Taxonomy Initiative, GTI) and strengthening informatics infrastructure in the Pacific region.   Academic collaborations on biodiversity facilitate achievement by CBD Parties in the region of Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 (invasive alien species) and Target 19 (Biodiversity science).</p>

<p><strong>The Ebbe Nielsen Prize</strong> is an annual prize established by the GBIF Governing Board to honour the memory of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121212014425/http://www.gbif.org:80/communications/news-and-events/ebbe-nielsen-prize/ebbe-nielsen-obituary">Ebbe Schmidt Nielsen</a>, who was an inspirational leader in the fields of biosystematics and biodiversity informatics and one of the driving leaders promoting the establishment of GBIF.</p>
<p>The prize is awarded annually to a promising researcher, usually in the early stages of his/her career, who is combining biosystematics and biodiversity informatics research in an exciting and novel way.</p>
<p>Nominations are submitted by GBIF Participants to the GBIF Science Committee, which selects the recipient. The prize is awarded at the GBIF Governing Board meeting and consists of 30,000 Euros, to be used by the recipient to further his/her research.</p>
<p>If you are interested in applying for this prize, please make note of the following conditions:</p>
<p>• Contact the GBIF Australia Head of Delegation (<a href="mailto:john.lasalle@csiro.au">john.lasalle@csiro.au</a>) as soon as possible to indicate your interest.</p>
<p>• Applications may only be submitted by the Head of Delegation on the applicant&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>• A maximum of two (2) applicants from each region are permitted.</p>
<p>• The deadline for nominations is the 15th February, 2013.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-size: small;">Deadline: 17 September 2012</span> </em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The GBIF Secretariat is inviting proposals from GBIF Nodes for activities to engage with data publishers to promote delivery of enriched metadata for existing and new datasets, and publication of data papers as an incentive for metadata publishing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The call is aimed at increasing awareness of the significance of metadata to enable discovery and use of datasets published through the GBIF network; and of the potential of peer-reviewed data papers to give due recognition to the efforts of those involved in data publishing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Individuals, data publishers and research groups wishing to participate in the call can <a href="mailto:beth.mantle@csiro.au">approach relevant GBIF Nodes</a> and team up with them to submit a proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Catalytic support for proposals will be in the range of €2000 to €5000.</span></p>
