										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time, the 2016 Atlas of Living Australia Science Symposium was held interstate and hosted by one of our partners, the Department of Parks and Wildlife in Perth, Western Australia.</p>
<p>We had a full program, with many stimulating talks. With thanks to the authors who have made them available, copies of the presentations can be found <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/2016-science-symposium-presentations/"><strong>HERE</strong></a>. Some presentations contained information that has not yet been published and for this reason cannot be made public at this stage.</p>
<p>This is our third Science Symposium, and it seems to me that each year they just get better.  Not only have we had a great deal of positive feedback on the quality and enthusiasm of the various participants – but the range of topics and ways the ALA is supporting people and activities seems to grow every year.  Again this year one of the main successes of the Symposium was seeing how the Atlas community is coming together and is excited about our shared future.  As stimulating as the presentations and discussions were, the sense of excitement I saw in the room during the breaks was even more impressive.  Everywhere there were lively discussions, interested people getting more information from presenters, and various networks being formed to develop and progress some of the emerging ideas.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who helped make the 2016 Atlas of Living Australia Science Symposium such a success.  This includes presenters, moderators, the Atlas staff who worked so hard at the organisation – but also all the participants who contributed through attending and creating such a lively atmosphere.  This high level of community engagement is compelling evidence of a strong future for the Atlas.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone at our next Symposium!</p>
