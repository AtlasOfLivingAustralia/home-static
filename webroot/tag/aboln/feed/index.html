<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atlas of Living Australia website has been operating since 2010 and provides free, online access to a vast repository of information about Australia&#8217;s biodiversity. It supports research, environmental monitoring, conservation planning, biosecurity activities, education, citizen science, and the digitisation of millions of existing physical records around the country. The Atlas has over 54 million records on approximately 110,566 Australian species (as at May 2015 and growing rapidly), these records can be investigated through individual species profiles containing photos and collections data, and by using the mapping and analysis tools developed by the Atlas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atlas of Living Australia would like to discover more about how the Atlas assists users to gain further information on Australian species and how the Atlas can improve for the future. An online survey has been developed to gain further insight into how you use the Atlas and an opportunity for you to provide the Atlas with some important feedback. No matter how much or how little you use the Atlas of Living Australia, we would like to hear from you &#8211; as an added incentive, you could win a fantastic Atlas of Living Australia prize pack, including your very own cap, t-shirt, and coffee mug!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information gathered from this survey will be critical to ensuring we can provide the highest level of information and tools to support our users, national research, our partners, and the future of Australia&#8217;s biodiversity.</p>
<p>To complete the survey <a href="http://pages.exacttarget.com/page.aspx?QS=5c591a8916642e73dfcff30dab56f7492b5e6f1034660ec15e9f8cc59f1442f9" target="_blank">click here</a>. The survey will close on June 1st 2015.</p>
<p>The Atlas receives support from the Australian Government through the <a href="https://education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris" target="_blank">National Research Infrastructure for Australia</a> (NCRIS).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="media-release">Media Release</h2>
<p>In just 10 weeks a team of Canadian researchers has succeeded in &#8216;barcoding&#8217; 28,000 moth and butterfly specimens – or about 65 per cent of Australia’s 10,000 known species – held at CSIRO&#8217;s Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC) in Canberra.</p>
<p>Conducted in collaboration with the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) as part of the International Barcode of Life (IBoL), the project involved extracting DNA from each specimen to record its unique genetic code and entering the results, together with an image and other details, to the ALA and ANIC databases.</p>
<p>ANIC is the first national collection to integrate the new barcoding approach for a major group of insects.</p>
<p>The Collection’s Director, Dr John La Salle, said DNA barcoding is a kind of ‘genetic fingerprinting’ which has proven useful in identifying different forms of life.</p>
<p>“Barcoding will be critically important to our goal of being able to rapidly identify most organisms on the planet within the next decade or so,” Dr La Salle said.</p>
<p>“This will produce strong benefits for entomology, life sciences and biosecurity.”</p>
<p>He said barcoding has already achieved some interesting successes in, for example, Europe and the US where it is being used to investigate food fraud, such as selling one type of fish as another type of fish.</p>
<p>According to Atlas of Living Australia Director, Donald Hobern, many moths and butterflies are of economic and/or environmental importance to Australia.</p>
<p>“Using barcoding for rapid species identification will transform how we handle monitoring of biodiversity across Australia and how we respond to potential pest arrivals at Australian borders,” Mr Hobern said.</p>
<p>“Barcoding for rapid species identification is a powerful new tool which will also assist taxonomists in recognising and describing new species.”</p>
