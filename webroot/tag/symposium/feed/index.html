										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">With the 2014 ALA Science Symposium now fading into memory I wanted to record a few thoughts about this year’s event.</span></p>
<p>The focus of the previous (2013) ALA Symposium was the achievements of the project and our wider partner community.  This year we shifted some of the focus to where we are going, what we are currently working on, and what you can expect to see soon.  There was still room for some reflection, with the panels providing a great opportunity for conversations as a group about where we want to head.</p>
<p>We had a full program, with many stimulating talks and a couple of chances for lively discussion. Copies of the presentations can be found <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><a title="2014 Symposium Presentations" href="http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/communications-centre/presentations/2014-symposium-presentations/">HERE</a>, </strong><span style="font-size: small;">and many thanks to the authors who have made them available.</span></span></p>
<p>We have had nothing but positive feedback on the symposium – and most particularly on the quality and enthusiasm of the various participants.  For me one of the main successes of the Symposium was seeing how the Atlas community is coming together and is excited about our shared future.  As stimulating as the presentations and discussions were, the sense of excitement I saw in the room during the breaks was even more impressive.  Everywhere there were lively discussions, interested people getting more information from presenters, and various networks being formed to develop and progress some of the emerging ideas.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who helped make the 2014 Atlas of Living Australia Science Symposium such a success.  This includes presenters, moderators, panellists, the Atlas staff who worked so hard at the organisation – but also all the participants who contributed through attending and creating such a lively atmosphere.  This high level of community engagement is compelling evidence of a strong future for the Atlas.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone at our next Symposium!</p>
<p>John La Salle</p>
