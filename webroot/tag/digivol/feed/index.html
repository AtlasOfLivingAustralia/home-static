<p><em>WeDigBio,</em> short for Worldwide Engagement for Digitizing Bio-collections, is a four-day global event taking place during October 22-25 2015, that will engage participants in transcribing biodiversity research collections. The public can join WeDigBio and scientists from around the world to transform biodiversity collections data into a worldwide resource that will enhance the span of biodiversity research across time, taxa, and geographies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wedigbio.org/" target="_blank">WeDigBio</a> event emerged within the museum community to increase the rate of digital data creation. This one-of-a-kind event will be held across 30 locations across the globe, but you don&#8217;t have to be at one of these locations to get involved.</p>
<p>Through the <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> portal, the <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/" target="_blank">Australian Museum</a> will be joining in on the WeDigBio fun this year and they&#8217;ll be looking for volunteers online and onsite to join the blitz.</p>
<p>The Australian Museum has more than 18 million specimens hidden within its buildings. The labels that are attached to these specimens contain data that is important in the study of the diversity of plants and animals. Many of these specimens do not have a digital record attached to them, making this information unavailable to researchers and scientists, but with the help of Citizen Scientists these specimens are receiving the digitisation treatment.</p>
<p>For those in Sydney, you can join in the fun at the Australian Museum as they will be holding a free admission, onsite transcription event on Saturday 24 October. Bring your laptop and join the team for coffee and cake and an afternoon of transcribing, you can learn how to use DigiVol and explore other transcriptions sites from around the world. For further information and registration for the Sydney event please email: DigiVol@austmus.gov.au</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Investigating the decline of our native species</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/wildcount.htm" target="_blank">WildCount</a> project is an initiative from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage and National Parks and Wildlife Service and is a 10-year monitoring program that uses 300 motion-sensitive digital cameras across 146 National parks and reserves. It looks at trends around what animals are present at these sites and how many there are, to understand if native species are in decline, increasing in number or stable.</p>
<p>Since the WildCount program started in 2012, over 800,000 images have been collected. Each year between February and May the WildCount team go out into the bush and set up the motion sensing cameras. They set up a lure of peanut butter and honey in a tea ball to attract the animals and wait two weeks before retrieving the cameras to see what they have captured.</p>
<p>The only problem is that when the team are done with checking all the cameras, there will be around 280,000 images captured. This takes a small team of researchers and volunteers almost a whole year to process accurately. While about one third of all the images contain no animals, WildCount has captured some truly weird and wonderful animal interactions so far, like a pair of wallabies having a hug, a curious emu, a Lyre bird attacking a black snake and a wombat crossing paths with a spider.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVunfaniOLM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How can Citizen Scientists help? </strong></p>
<p>The WildCount team is now looking to Citizen Scientists to help sift through this vast volume of ‘animal selfies’ to see if they can process the data much faster whilst still maintain the scientific accuracy of the study.  If you know what a kangaroo, emu, echidna or possum looks like or the name of the bird on the Australian 10c piece you’ve got the skills to be a citizen scientist on the WildCount project.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34888" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z-1.jpg" alt="14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z-1.jpg 640w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/14873087027_c7ffdb6e65_z-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Citizen Scientists will use <a href="http://www.digivol.org">DigiVol</a>, a website developed by the Australian Museum and the Atlas of Living Australia, to record information from each image such as the number of animals in the photograph and the name of the species. DigiVol has been primarily used for unlocking scientific data from the biodiversity collections of institutions in Australia and around the world including the Smithsonian, Kew Gardens, South Australian Museum, Museum Victoria, CSIRO’s Australian National Insect Collection, Harvard University and many more. Its innovative and flexible online platform provides institutions with an easy to use interface for hosting their own “virtual expeditions” and is perfect for hosting WildCount. More importantly DigiVol provides an interesting and fun way for citizen scientists to contribute to science.</p>
<p>After the images are processed the WildCount team and experts will verify the species identification and counts. They are currently with biostatisticians from industry and CSIRO to help them detect changes in the occurrence of several Australian small-medium mammal species such as the brush tail possum, rock wallaby, lyrebird, grey kangaroo and the common wombat over 10 years. This will help understand if there are changes occurring that meet the criteria for listing species under the IUCN Red List. The power to detect such changes means scientists have an early warning system to see what is happening to common native species as well as examine other trends such as increase in pest species like red foxes.</p>

<p>By helping to capture this information, the community would be helping scientists understand changes in native and pest species which will assist in the management of NSW&#8217;s precious biodiversity in National parks and reserves. It may also uncover a few weird and wonderful animal interactions or even prove the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_bear" target="_blank">Drop Bears</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyip" target="_blank">Bunyips</a> once and for all!</p>
<p>It is hoped that many Citizen Scientists will join DigiVol and not only help with WildCount but the many other worthwhile &#8220;virtual expeditions&#8221; on DigiVol. Over the past four years DigiVol has seen over 1000 volunteers capture data from more than 170,000 labels and field note pages from museums and collections.</p>
<p><strong>You can take part in the WildCount DigiVol expedition <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/7878939" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>The WildCount DigiVol expedition is a collaboration between the NSW  Office of Environment and Heritage, The Australian Museum  and the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). The data from this project will be processed via DigiVol and uploaded to the ALA website and the data archived and made available through NSW BioNet Wildlife Atlas.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/">Australian Museum</a>, developed <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> to harness the power of online volunteers to digitise biodiversity data that is locked up in biodiversity collections, field notebooks and survey sheets. DigiVol has attracted volunteers from all walks of life, and they are proud to announce that the 1000th volunteer has just joined the community!</p>
<p>DigiVol enables volunteers from around the world to transcribe handwritten diaries, scientist notebooks and specimen labels, and identify location data – in turn creating a digital record for physical ones. Through DigiVol, volunteers are helping museums and universities to make their research material available to everyone online. The data has many uses but most important is that it can help scientists and planning officials better understand, utilise, manage and conserve Australia’s precious biodiversity.</p>
<p>Paul Flemons is Head of Citizen Science at Australia Museum and the manager of DigiVol, he explains “DigiVol enables the public to contribute to the process of scientific discovery in a way never previously possible. This is invaluable to museums in a time of scarce government funding.”</p>
<p>Each DigiVol project is called an Expedition and can contain a number of pages or specimens that need to be transcribed into a digital version. Megan Edey as the largest contributor to DigiVol has completed over 40,000 tasks! Megan explains more about her work “I like doing both the insect and the diary expeditions on DigiVol. I especially liked working on the Edgar Waite diaries and following his life story. DigiVol is interspersed throughout my day, I sometimes log on in between doing the washing or feeding the horses or whenever the family are watching something boring on TV!  I can be logged on for between 2 and 5 hours a day.”</p>

He accompanied various trawling expeditions in the Pacific and sub-Antarctic and wrote of his work in diaries now housed in the Australian Museum Archives Collection.</p>
<p>The unique volunteer experience is explained in this <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/blogpost/science/transcriptions-molluscs">Australian Museum blog</a> &#8220;Different volunteers enjoy different tasks, with some of them becoming obsessed with the lives of the diary writers, others with transcribing insect labels. All of their efforts are captured in the DigiVol Honour Board where they aspire to be a Weekly Wonder, Monthly Maestro or DigiVol Legend by transcribing the most tasks weekly, monthly and overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>DigiVol and its capability to assist with the enormous task of digitising their collections  is not restricted to Australia’s museums and collections either;  institutions like the <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/institution/index/4940813" target="_blank">Smithsonian</a>, <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/2277905" target="_blank">New York Botanic Gardens</a>, and <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/4725119" target="_blank">Kew Gardens</a> have also chosen DigiVol to host their own virtual expeditions to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.botany.unimelb.edu.au/herbarium/" target="_blank">University of Melbourne Herbarium</a> is the latest collection institution to join in the DigiVol effort, with their <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/7314225" target="_blank">first expedition</a> focusing on legume specimens from the Burnley Horticultural College.</p>
<p>If you’d like to get involved and join DigiVol, simply head to <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">www.volunteer.ala.org.au</a> and there&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/181836918595085/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> too. Happy transcribing!</p>
