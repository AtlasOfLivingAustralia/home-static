										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After many months of work, a major upgrade to the taxonomic backbone of the ALA will go live this week.</p>
<p>Users will recognise a change to the look and feel of the species pages, and major improvements to the search and quality of results on our species lists.</p>
<p>The focus was to update the naming system and bring it up to speed with the key authoritative sources, namely: the Australian Plant Name Index (APNI), Australian Plant Census (APC) and the Australian Faunal Directory from the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS) as well as Australian Fungi, Australian Mosses Online, Australian Codes of Aquatic Biota, Catalogue of Life, and the New Zealand Organisms Register.</p>
<p>This was a major piece of work requiring a complete rewrite of some of the ALA’s original software. The major benefits to users will be an improvement to the quality of species information. In addition, duplicate records have been removed and, where possible, links to the original source data have been included.</p>
<p>Naming and classification of biological organisms (taxonomy) is one of the most fundamental streams of science. It aims to provide a complete list of all living organisms on the planet and their relationships to eachother. By establishing a common language for all organisms and their taxonomic categories, it enables scientists across the globe to communicate and collaborate effectively.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think that a list of names is more or less set in stone but taxonomy is surprisingly dynamic and changes occur frequently. The ALA upgrade makes it easier for us to update our species lists on a regular basis. As a result, we can keep the ALA species lists up-to-date with developments or changes in taxonomic science.</p>
<p>This is a major change and so we won’t be surprised if users encounter some (not many!) issues in the first few weeks after release. Please <a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">contact us</a> if you need assistance.</p>
<p>Many thanks to all our colleagues at ABRS, APNI, APC, the Council of Heads of Australiasian Herbaria (CHAH), as well as Tom May and Niels Klazenga at the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The striking black and white patterned Magpie Fiddler Ray, has been long listed as one of South Australia’s rarest fishes, but there has always been doubt that this was a separate species from the more common and widespread sandy and brown coloured Southern Fiddler Ray. The colours and patterns were clearly different, but with just two other minor differences in their appearance, the scientific community had its doubts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35032" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35032" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-35032" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/09/Fiddler-Specimen-collage-2015-09-07-1.jpg" alt="Visually different but what about genetically?

<p>Given that the Magpie Fiddler Ray is listed as threatened by the IUCN Red List, and immature male fiddlers are common in prawn trawl bycatch, it was important to clear this up. Clarifying whether it was a different species would have an impact on its conservation status and approach to management.</p>
<p>Conservation management of naturally rare or seldom encountered fish can be tricky, as documenting changes to abundance can be a challenging task. The Magpie Fiddler Ray was considered to be genuinely rare, not just hard to observe, because all known specimens were found in shallow waters of the well-populated and frequently trawled coastlines of the Gulf of St Vincent and Kangaroo Island.</p>
<p>DNA analysis would have resolved the issue once and for all. However scientists were thwarted by a lack of specimens suitable for DNA analysis and its apparent rarity as the Magpie Fiddler Ray was known, until recently, from only a <a href="http://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/dbe8cd6b-4333-483f-b569-6273b57fe23a">single specimen</a> deposited in the South Australian Museum over 60 years ago.</p>
<p>Scientists couldn’t wait 60 years for another Magpie Fiddler Ray to show up, so the South Australian Museum turned to the citizen scientist community for help. From 2001 it issued calls through the media and recreational fishing websites for people to watch out for specimens of this elusive but easily recognised species.</p>
<p>Those calls were successful, with two specimens and three new photographic records of the Magpie Fiddler Ray coming through from the recreational fishing community between 2001 and 2013. Surprisingly, most were from the Adelaide suburban coast and the Port River.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35019" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35019" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-35019 size-full" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/09/Magpie-ray-John-Marsh-SA-1.jpg" alt="Magpie Fiddler Ray" width="520" height="693" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/09/Magpie-ray-John-Marsh-SA-1.jpg 520w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/09/Magpie-ray-John-Marsh-SA-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35019" class="wp-caption-text">A fisherman rarely catches a Magpie Fiddler Ray: on the line and in a photo! Photo courtesy of John Marsh</figcaption></figure>
<p>This gave the team enough material to work with. They used the latest DNA sequencing technology to compare the genome of these new Magpie Fiddler Ray specimens with 50 specimens of the Southern Fiddler Ray. They also analysed examples of the Eastern Fiddler Ray, to provide a ‘yardstick’ for the between species. All comparative samples were drawn from the South Australian Museum’s phenomenal <a href="http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/collections/biological-sciences/biological-tissues">Australian Biological Tissue Collection</a>, the largest in the southern hemisphere, with more than 138,000 animal tissues available for genetic analysis collected over five decades.</p>
<p>Genetic analysis of the specimens showed very clear results. The Southern and Eastern Fiddler Rays were clearly highly distinct, and in contrast the two Magpie Fiddler Ray specimens were obviously members of the Southern Fiddler Ray gene pool.</p>
<p>Scientists simultaneously re-examined the appearance of these rays, including their shape, length and skin features but found no significant differences apart from the colour pattern. The strongly black and white pattern of the Magpie Fiddler Ray could be attributed to ‘leucism’, a condition that results in loss of pigmentation that isn’t uncommon in many kinds of fishes and other vertebrates.</p>
<p>And so the team was able to demonstrate that the Magpie Fiddler Ray, isn’t its own species at all, but is a colour variation of the common and widespread Southern Fiddler Ray. They published their results in the scientific journal “<a href="http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/list/2015/3981(3).html">Zootaxa</a>” in July 2015. Distribution maps of the Fiddler Ray species based on museum collection records from all over the country, are available through the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a>.</p>
<p>Professor Steve Donnellan, Chief Research Scientist at the South Australian Museum’s Evolutionary Biology Unit commented that “this is the sort of science that museum researchers love doing, it involves interested members of the public to solve long-standing mysteries and of course we couldn’t do it without the efforts of many people over many decades accumulating invaluable specimens, tissues and records in our museums. It’s this sort of approach involving focused public partnerships that we like to use increasingly to solve issues in our fish research program.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed that the Atlas of Living Australia website has gone through a few changes in appearance over the past 6 months. We are currently upgrading our user interfaces to be consistent with our refreshed homepage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week the Atlas released a redesigned version of our <a href="http://sightings.ala.org.au/">Report a Sighting</a> page, which allows users to report on sightings of species and upload their images to the Atlas. The map functionality has been simplified and we&#8217;ve added a new tool called &#8220;location-based species suggestion tool&#8221; which provides thumbnail images of species that are known to occur in the user&#8217;s location. The page has also been optimised for use on mobile phones and tablets.</p>

<div class="mceTemp">A three year Atlas of Living Australia funded contract with the Australian Biological Resources Study has resulted in Australian researchers adding 29,864 species names to the Australian Faunal Directory and the Australian Plant Name Index. The contract was part of the Australian National Species Lists project.</div>
<div class="mceTemp"> </div>
<div class="mceTemp">The <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/">Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS)</a> component of the National Species Lists (NSL) project set out to update the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD) and to integrate names information for algae and lichens into the Australian Plant Name Index (APNI).</div>
<div class="mceTemp"> </div>
<div class="mceTemp">The names data sets are a critical part of biodiversity informatics infrastructure. For the Atlas of Living Australia, the lists provide the framework for integrating data. Dr John La Salle, Director of the Atlas has said “the species names delivered through this project are absolutely essential for the Atlas system itself and the overall study of biodiversity in Australia.”</div>

<p>ABRS managed 46 contracts for delivery of NSL names information over the three years of the project, with 44 of these for delivery of species information to the AFD. Some 104 external specialists contributed to the ABRS component of the NSL project. They were responsible for updating and compiling taxonomic and nomenclatural information about fauna and algae. The project formally concluded in September 2012, however, additions to the databases are still occurring with compilers still adding data to the AFD.</p>
