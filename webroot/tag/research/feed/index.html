<p>At the beginning of 2015, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) took over the management of the free-to-use OzTrack application that facilitates the uploading, editing, analysis, archiving and sharing of datasets from animal tracking research projects. As part of the transition to the ALA, OzTrack has been re-released as <a href="http://www.zoatrack.org/" target="_blank">ZoaTrack</a> to reflect the growing international community of animal tracking scientists using the web-based application.  OzTrack was initially developed at The University of Queensland as part of a <a href="https://www.nectar.org.au/">NeCTAR</a>-funded collaboration between The University of Queensland’s Schools of Biological Sciences, the Environmental Decisions Group, and the School of <a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/eresearch">ITEE eResearch Lab</a>.  When the initial project ended, the ALA stepped in to ensure the continued development and maintenance of the system with the long term goal of integrating the toolset into the ALA’s suite, and ensuring the legacy of existing animal location datasets.</p>

<p>Animal telemetry studies generate a wealth of complex data issues with formats, map projections, timestamps, algorithms and calculations.  ZoaTrack’s goals are to make spatial analytics tools easily accessible, so that researchers can spend less time wrangling the technology, and more time on science.   ZoaTrack has a broad base of research organisations involved in both the user community and on the steering committee.  The site manages both terrestrial and marine data and has an impressive collection of datasets across many locations and species. Users have the choice to openly share their datasets, or keep their data under embargo for a determined period.  The software is all open source so is free to use.  Once raw data is uploaded, users can easily run commonly used home range estimation algorithms and generate heat maps. They can add environment layers, do velocity and trajectory calculations, as well as apply cleansing filters and tools. Data and results can be exported in multiple formats.</p>
<p>Studies using ZoaTrack can be easily investigated from the site and showcase some intriguing case studies, including tracks made by <a href="http://zoatrack.org/projects/140/analysis">Koalas</a>, <a href="http://zoatrack.org/projects/2/analysis">Cassowaries</a>, and <a href="http://oztrack.org/projects/3/analysis">Crocodiles</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The striking black and white patterned Magpie Fiddler Ray, has been long listed as one of South Australia’s rarest fishes, but there has always been doubt that this was a separate species from the more common and widespread sandy and brown coloured Southern Fiddler Ray. The colours and patterns were clearly different, but with just two other minor differences in their appearance, the scientific community had its doubts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35032" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35032" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-35032" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/09/Fiddler-Specimen-collage-2015-09-07-1.jpg" alt="Visually different but what about genetically?

<p>Given that the Magpie Fiddler Ray is listed as threatened by the IUCN Red List, and immature male fiddlers are common in prawn trawl bycatch, it was important to clear this up. Clarifying whether it was a different species would have an impact on its conservation status and approach to management.</p>
<p>Conservation management of naturally rare or seldom encountered fish can be tricky, as documenting changes to abundance can be a challenging task. The Magpie Fiddler Ray was considered to be genuinely rare, not just hard to observe, because all known specimens were found in shallow waters of the well-populated and frequently trawled coastlines of the Gulf of St Vincent and Kangaroo Island.</p>
<p>DNA analysis would have resolved the issue once and for all. However scientists were thwarted by a lack of specimens suitable for DNA analysis and its apparent rarity as the Magpie Fiddler Ray was known, until recently, from only a <a href="http://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/dbe8cd6b-4333-483f-b569-6273b57fe23a">single specimen</a> deposited in the South Australian Museum over 60 years ago.</p>
<p>Scientists couldn’t wait 60 years for another Magpie Fiddler Ray to show up, so the South Australian Museum turned to the citizen scientist community for help. From 2001 it issued calls through the media and recreational fishing websites for people to watch out for specimens of this elusive but easily recognised species.</p>
<p>Those calls were successful, with two specimens and three new photographic records of the Magpie Fiddler Ray coming through from the recreational fishing community between 2001 and 2013. Surprisingly, most were from the Adelaide suburban coast and the Port River.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35019" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35019" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-35019 size-full" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/09/Magpie-ray-John-Marsh-SA-1.jpg" alt="Magpie Fiddler Ray" width="520" height="693" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/09/Magpie-ray-John-Marsh-SA-1.jpg 520w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/09/Magpie-ray-John-Marsh-SA-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35019" class="wp-caption-text">A fisherman rarely catches a Magpie Fiddler Ray: on the line and in a photo! Photo courtesy of John Marsh</figcaption></figure>
<p>This gave the team enough material to work with. They used the latest DNA sequencing technology to compare the genome of these new Magpie Fiddler Ray specimens with 50 specimens of the Southern Fiddler Ray. They also analysed examples of the Eastern Fiddler Ray, to provide a ‘yardstick’ for the between species. All comparative samples were drawn from the South Australian Museum’s phenomenal <a href="http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/collections/biological-sciences/biological-tissues">Australian Biological Tissue Collection</a>, the largest in the southern hemisphere, with more than 138,000 animal tissues available for genetic analysis collected over five decades.</p>
<p>Genetic analysis of the specimens showed very clear results. The Southern and Eastern Fiddler Rays were clearly highly distinct, and in contrast the two Magpie Fiddler Ray specimens were obviously members of the Southern Fiddler Ray gene pool.</p>
<p>Scientists simultaneously re-examined the appearance of these rays, including their shape, length and skin features but found no significant differences apart from the colour pattern. The strongly black and white pattern of the Magpie Fiddler Ray could be attributed to ‘leucism’, a condition that results in loss of pigmentation that isn’t uncommon in many kinds of fishes and other vertebrates.</p>
<p>And so the team was able to demonstrate that the Magpie Fiddler Ray, isn’t its own species at all, but is a colour variation of the common and widespread Southern Fiddler Ray. They published their results in the scientific journal “<a href="http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/list/2015/3981(3).html">Zootaxa</a>” in July 2015. Distribution maps of the Fiddler Ray species based on museum collection records from all over the country, are available through the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a>.</p>
<p>Professor Steve Donnellan, Chief Research Scientist at the South Australian Museum’s Evolutionary Biology Unit commented that “this is the sort of science that museum researchers love doing, it involves interested members of the public to solve long-standing mysteries and of course we couldn’t do it without the efforts of many people over many decades accumulating invaluable specimens, tissues and records in our museums. It’s this sort of approach involving focused public partnerships that we like to use increasingly to solve issues in our fish research program.”</p>
