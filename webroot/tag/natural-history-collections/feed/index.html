										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month (11-17 May 2015) marked <a href="http://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/national-volunteer-week-2015/" target="_blank">National Volunteer Week</a>, a week dedicated to celebrating and thanking the 6 million Australian volunteers who spend their time enriching and improving Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s biodiversity knowledge and conservation is strongly supported and powered by volunteers, with plenty of people choosing to spend their time in the great outdoors; improving, protecting, and promoting our unique ecosystems. Biodiversity volunteers aren&#8217;t just out in the bush though. Many help behind-the-scenes in our museums, galleries, herbariums, and collections. People from all walks of life are getting involved in the enormous effort to digitise the vast collections of records and specimens held by such institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldwide, an estimated five million invertebrate species are yet to be described, according to the<em><a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/node/13866" target="_blank"> Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World</a></em>.  Invertebrates – animals without a backbone or vertebral column – are the most abundant group of animals on earth and yet they are the least documented. In Australia alone there are around 98,000 described species and an estimated 222,000 that are still unknown to science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The South Australian Museum holds around two million specimens in its terrestrial invertebrate collection and around 1.75 million marine invertebrates. The Museum has begun a digitisation program to help address this backlog, and their doing this vital work using the Atlas of Living Australia and Australian Museum developed <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about the efforts of the SA Museum volunteers and the importance of their work, <a href="http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/media/unlocked/online-volunteers-help-scientists-speed-up-species-discovery-and-focus-research" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While National Volunteer Week concludes for another year, the volunteering efforts to transform biological expedition diaries and specimen tags never ends. If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, please visit our <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol volunteer page </a> and best of all you don&#8217;t even need to leave the house to join in the fun of transcription!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was early in 2014 that the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) announced that it had reached one billion downloads and now in 2015, the ALA is proud to announce another great achievement.<br />
Thanks to the dedicated work of the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/atlas-background/atlas-partners/ala-community/" target="_blank">partnering natural history collections</a>, which continue to digitise and share their collections with the Atlas, the total number of collections-based records on the ALA database has clicked over 10 million!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_34185" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34185" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ANIC_2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-34185" src="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ANIC_2.jpg" alt="There are over 34 million biological specimens in Australia’s museums.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The specimens held by Australia’s natural history collections underpin our knowledge of Australia’s biodiversity. What sets collections-based records apart from other (mostly observational) records in the ALA is that they are all based on preserved specimens housed in museums and herbaria. These specimens provide a permanent record of the occurrence of a species at a particular place and time, and are the primary resource for research on the classification and distribution of Australian plants, animals and fungi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_34187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34187" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AD13.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-34187" src="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AD13.jpg" alt="As well as making collections data available online, museum and herbarium collections are visited by researchers who need to inspect the specimens in person.

Copyright: State Herbarium of South Australia.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the data is based on physical specimens that can be re-examined, the identification of suspect records can be checked and the data can be kept up to date as species concepts change, and as our understanding of Australia’s biodiversity improves. They can also document changes in individual species through time: specimens collected in the past may present traits that differ slightly from what can be seen in the wild today. Museums and herbaria also house specimens of species that are now extinct in the wild, sometimes providing the only physical evidence that a species ever existed!</p>

<p>Specimen records are important for scientific research, and natural history collections are critical references for scientists from a vast breadth of the biological and environmental science disciplines. For example, researchers used museum paleontological specimens, preserved skeleton DNA and contemporary DNA to prove that the <a href="http://bie.ala.org.au/species/Sula+dactylatra+tasmani#tab_gallery" target="_blank">Tasman Booby</a>, a bird <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114125252/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090811-extinct-booby-masked.html" target="_blank">believed to be extinct</a>, was still living on islands in the North Tasman Sea (<a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/94" target="_blank">Steeves <em>et al</em>. 2010</a>).</p>
<figure id="attachment_34199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34199" style="width: 657px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/05/PreservedSpecimen-records-in-the-Atlas-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-34199" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/05/PreservedSpecimen-records-in-the-Atlas-1.jpg" alt="The Atlas now holds over 10 million records of specimens held in natural history collections.

Each brown dot represents where a specimen has been collected from.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the collecting data associated with a specimen is made visible on the ALA website, it is accessible to the entire world: geographical impediments to closer investigation are minimised.<br />
Along with the collecting of data, high quality images of specimens are increasingly becoming available through the ALA. This allows researchers to investigate specimens from all over Australia – often in microscopic detail. As well as making access to collections data much easier, aggregating the specimen data from multiple collections in the one place allows researchers to investigate biodiversity in new ways.</p>

<p>Collections-based data are being enthusiastically used by the research community right now – scientific researchers, ecological researchers, and conservation management/planning have been the largest groups of users. The 10 million+ records from natural history collections in the ALA have been part of almost 140,000 separate download events in the last 12 months, totalling more than 550 million data points downloaded.<br />
The 10 millionth record was provided by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (<a href="http://www.magnt.net.au/" target="_blank">MAGNT</a>), who are just one of the many collections who are regularly contributing to the ALA database.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> is a collaboration between the <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/" target="_blank">Australian Museum</a> and the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a> that was initially an experimental foray into crowd-sourcing. At the time, the notion that there were online volunteers willing to help natural history collections capture their data seemed rather far-fetched.</p>
<figure style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" class=" " style="text-align: center; background-color: #f3f3f3;" src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AustMuseum-379x254-custom.jpg" alt="An Australian Museum staff member inspects a tray of shells." width="341" height="229" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Melissa Graf © Australian Museum</figcaption></figure>
<p>It was definitely a risk: crowd-sourcing was in its infancy and there were no other museums providing online volunteers with an opportunity to help digitise their natural history collections. But now, DigiVol has not only become a means for Australia’s museums to tackle the enormous task of digitising their collections, but institutions like the Smithsonian, New York Botanic Gardens, and Kew Gardens have also chosen DigiVol to host their own virtual expeditions to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>As further proof of DigiVol’s success, we recently recorded two impressive milestones. Our volunteers at <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol Online </a>have now completed over 100,000 transcription tasks, with some of our most prolific volunteers completing over 10,000 transcription tasks each. Also, in just two short years, <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/Rapid-Digitisation-Project" target="_blank">DigiVol Lab</a> volunteers at the Australian Museum have created over 70,000 images of the Museum’s very large Malacology (think molluscs, such as snails, slugs, clams, octopus and squid) collection. These milestones represent a monumental contribution to digitising the collections of museums and herbaria from Australia and around the world.</p>
