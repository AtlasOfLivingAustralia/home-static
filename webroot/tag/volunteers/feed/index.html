<p><em>WeDigBio,</em> short for Worldwide Engagement for Digitizing Bio-collections, is a four-day global event taking place during October 22-25 2015, that will engage participants in transcribing biodiversity research collections. The public can join WeDigBio and scientists from around the world to transform biodiversity collections data into a worldwide resource that will enhance the span of biodiversity research across time, taxa, and geographies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wedigbio.org/" target="_blank">WeDigBio</a> event emerged within the museum community to increase the rate of digital data creation. This one-of-a-kind event will be held across 30 locations across the globe, but you don&#8217;t have to be at one of these locations to get involved.</p>
<p>Through the <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> portal, the <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/" target="_blank">Australian Museum</a> will be joining in on the WeDigBio fun this year and they&#8217;ll be looking for volunteers online and onsite to join the blitz.</p>
<p>The Australian Museum has more than 18 million specimens hidden within its buildings. The labels that are attached to these specimens contain data that is important in the study of the diversity of plants and animals. Many of these specimens do not have a digital record attached to them, making this information unavailable to researchers and scientists, but with the help of Citizen Scientists these specimens are receiving the digitisation treatment.</p>
<p>For those in Sydney, you can join in the fun at the Australian Museum as they will be holding a free admission, onsite transcription event on Saturday 24 October. Bring your laptop and join the team for coffee and cake and an afternoon of transcribing, you can learn how to use DigiVol and explore other transcriptions sites from around the world. For further information and registration for the Sydney event please email: DigiVol@austmus.gov.au</p>

<p>Biodiversity data transcribed through the DigiVol is uploaded to the Atlas of Living Australia for future research use and to support biodiversity knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month (11-17 May 2015) marked <a href="http://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/national-volunteer-week-2015/" target="_blank">National Volunteer Week</a>, a week dedicated to celebrating and thanking the 6 million Australian volunteers who spend their time enriching and improving Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s biodiversity knowledge and conservation is strongly supported and powered by volunteers, with plenty of people choosing to spend their time in the great outdoors; improving, protecting, and promoting our unique ecosystems. Biodiversity volunteers aren&#8217;t just out in the bush though. Many help behind-the-scenes in our museums, galleries, herbariums, and collections. People from all walks of life are getting involved in the enormous effort to digitise the vast collections of records and specimens held by such institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldwide, an estimated five million invertebrate species are yet to be described, according to the<em><a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/node/13866" target="_blank"> Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World</a></em>.  Invertebrates – animals without a backbone or vertebral column – are the most abundant group of animals on earth and yet they are the least documented. In Australia alone there are around 98,000 described species and an estimated 222,000 that are still unknown to science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The South Australian Museum holds around two million specimens in its terrestrial invertebrate collection and around 1.75 million marine invertebrates. The Museum has begun a digitisation program to help address this backlog, and their doing this vital work using the Atlas of Living Australia and Australian Museum developed <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While National Volunteer Week concludes for another year, the volunteering efforts to transform biological expedition diaries and specimen tags never ends. If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, please visit our <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol volunteer page </a> and best of all you don&#8217;t even need to leave the house to join in the fun of transcription!</p>
