                In the coming months, we at the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) will be undertaking a User Experience review of www.ala.org.au in order to improve and refine the way that you use our site. Our main goal is to enhance your overall user experience.
              </p>
<p>
                But this is just the first of many steps. We will be making small and regular changes to the ALA using the continuous delivery methodology – this means releasing updates and improvements in short cycles. Our goal is to reduce the pain associated with large releases, to gain faster feedback from you, our users, and to offer incremental and continuous increases in the value of the ALA.
              </p>
<p>
                If you would like to ask us questions or to be part of the feedback process, contact the UI team at <a href="mailto:info@ala.org.au">info@ala.org.au</a>.
              </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed that the Atlas of Living Australia website has gone through a few changes in appearance over the past 6 months. We are currently upgrading our user interfaces to be consistent with our refreshed homepage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week the Atlas released a redesigned version of our <a href="http://sightings.ala.org.au/">Report a Sighting</a> page, which allows users to report on sightings of species and upload their images to the Atlas. The map functionality has been simplified and we&#8217;ve added a new tool called &#8220;location-based species suggestion tool&#8221; which provides thumbnail images of species that are known to occur in the user&#8217;s location. The page has also been optimised for use on mobile phones and tablets.</p>

<p>The Atlas has some exciting new identification tools in development that are soon to be released. We are also working on the capability to join the Atlas through your existing Social Media profiles such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google.</p>
