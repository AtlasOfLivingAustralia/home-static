										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A team of Victorian researchers has analysed data extracted from over three million plant specimens to reconstruct the introduction of invasive plant species into Australia for the first time.</strong></p>
<p>Invasive plants are estimated to cost the Australian economy over $4 billion a year through lost production and increased control costs.  They have also been linked to the extinction of several endangered species.  Understanding how invasive species are introduced into Australia helps put steps in place to prevent them getting here in the first place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://avh.chah.org.au" target="_blank">Australia’s Virtual Herbarium</a> (AVH) brings together specimen data from many of Australia’s herbaria (specialised museums that house collections of dried plants, algae and fungi) and makes it freely available on the web, providing the most complete and up-to-date picture of Australia’s botanical diversity available.</p>
<p>Researchers from a joint project between the University of Melbourne and the Victorian Government used the data stored with each plant specimen to pinpoint where and when species were found in Australia for the first time.  By matching this with information about where else in the world the species was found, and what types of things people used the species for, the researchers were able to estimate the species most likely pathway of introduction into Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_34922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34922" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://images.ala.org.au/image/view/96820178"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-34922" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/AVH2-1.jpg" alt="The first herbarium record of Ulex europaeus (Gorse) from Australia; collected at Studley Park, Melbourne in 1884 by Felix Reader." width="393" height="600" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/AVH2-1.jpg 671w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/AVH2-1-197x300.jpg 197w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-34922" class="wp-caption-text">The first herbarium record of <em>Ulex europaeus</em> (Gorse) from Australia; collected at Studley Park, Melbourne in 1884 by Felix Reader.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What we found was that the pathways of introduction have diversified substantially over the last 150 years.  In the early years after European settlement, we saw mostly grasses and legumes used for food or fodder arrive from Europe, whereas the species arriving now come from all corners of the globe for mostly ornamental purposes”, said Aaron Dodd, the lead author of the study.</p>
<p>Large-scale research projects like this one demonstrate the importance of expertly identified, specimen-based records for research and how this information can be used to inform areas other than plant taxonomy.  Such projects have only become possible through the recent digitisation of the physical specimens held by herbaria and the sharing of that information via portals such as AVH and the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a> (ALA).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was early in 2014 that the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) announced that it had reached one billion downloads and now in 2015, the ALA is proud to announce another great achievement.<br />
Thanks to the dedicated work of the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/atlas-background/atlas-partners/ala-community/" target="_blank">partnering natural history collections</a>, which continue to digitise and share their collections with the Atlas, the total number of collections-based records on the ALA database has clicked over 10 million!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_34185" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34185" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ANIC_2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-34185" src="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ANIC_2.jpg" alt="There are over 34 million biological specimens in Australia’s museums.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The specimens held by Australia’s natural history collections underpin our knowledge of Australia’s biodiversity. What sets collections-based records apart from other (mostly observational) records in the ALA is that they are all based on preserved specimens housed in museums and herbaria. These specimens provide a permanent record of the occurrence of a species at a particular place and time, and are the primary resource for research on the classification and distribution of Australian plants, animals and fungi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_34187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34187" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AD13.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-34187" src="https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AD13.jpg" alt="As well as making collections data available online, museum and herbarium collections are visited by researchers who need to inspect the specimens in person.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the data is based on physical specimens that can be re-examined, the identification of suspect records can be checked and the data can be kept up to date as species concepts change, and as our understanding of Australia’s biodiversity improves. They can also document changes in individual species through time: specimens collected in the past may present traits that differ slightly from what can be seen in the wild today. Museums and herbaria also house specimens of species that are now extinct in the wild, sometimes providing the only physical evidence that a species ever existed!</p>

<p>Specimen records are important for scientific research, and natural history collections are critical references for scientists from a vast breadth of the biological and environmental science disciplines. For example, researchers used museum paleontological specimens, preserved skeleton DNA and contemporary DNA to prove that the <a href="http://bie.ala.org.au/species/Sula+dactylatra+tasmani#tab_gallery" target="_blank">Tasman Booby</a>, a bird <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114125252/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090811-extinct-booby-masked.html" target="_blank">believed to be extinct</a>, was still living on islands in the North Tasman Sea (<a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/94" target="_blank">Steeves <em>et al</em>. 2010</a>).</p>
<figure id="attachment_34199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34199" style="width: 657px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/05/PreservedSpecimen-records-in-the-Atlas-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-34199" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/05/PreservedSpecimen-records-in-the-Atlas-1.jpg" alt="The Atlas now holds over 10 million records of specimens held in natural history collections.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the collecting data associated with a specimen is made visible on the ALA website, it is accessible to the entire world: geographical impediments to closer investigation are minimised.<br />
Along with the collecting of data, high quality images of specimens are increasingly becoming available through the ALA. This allows researchers to investigate specimens from all over Australia – often in microscopic detail. As well as making access to collections data much easier, aggregating the specimen data from multiple collections in the one place allows researchers to investigate biodiversity in new ways.</p>

<p>Collections-based data are being enthusiastically used by the research community right now – scientific researchers, ecological researchers, and conservation management/planning have been the largest groups of users. The 10 million+ records from natural history collections in the ALA have been part of almost 140,000 separate download events in the last 12 months, totalling more than 550 million data points downloaded.<br />
The 10 millionth record was provided by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (<a href="http://www.magnt.net.au/" target="_blank">MAGNT</a>), who are just one of the many collections who are regularly contributing to the ALA database.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) welcomes two new university herbaria collections: the <a title="Janet Cosh Herbarium" href="http://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co72" target="_blank">Janet Cosh Herbarium</a> (WOLL, based at the University of Wollongong), and the <a title="LTB" href="http://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/co33" target="_blank">La Trobe University Herbarium</a> (LTB).</p>
<p>University herbaria are important teaching collections, with specialised holdings that often reflect the diversity of the region in which the university is situated, as well as the professional expertise of the teaching staff. The inclusion of WOLL and LTB brings the number of registered herbaria contributing to the ALA to 13, which includes four of Australia’s 16 university herbaria.</p>

<p><strong>Janet Cosh Herbarium</strong></p>
<p>The Janet Cosh Herbarium (WOLL) was established in the University of Wollongong’s School of Biological Sciences in 1991 from a bequest made by the late Janet Cosh, an amateur botanist from the Southern Highlands of New South Wales. This remarkable woman began her botanical studies in her late 60s and over the next three decades became widely regarded as an expert on the local flora. By the time of her death in 1989 she had made two significant and highly professional collections of flora from the Sydney/Illawarra and Highlands regions, over 1500 of which formed the basis of the current collection at the University of Wollongong.</p>
<p>The Janet Cosh herbarium houses over <a title="WOLL Occurrence Record Map" href="http://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=collection_uid:co72#tab_mapView" target="_blank">11,000 specimens</a> of mainly vascular flora, with a focus on species present in the Sydney/Illawarra, South Coast and Southern Highlands regions of New South Wales. Ancillary collections include bryophytes collected by Prof. Sharon Robinson for studies of the effects of global warming on east Antarctic moss and lichen communities; Banksia pollen slides; Tasmanian and New Zealand bryophytes; and various marine macroalgae of the Sydney and South Coast region. The herbarium is currently open two days per week and provides plant identification services, training and teaching support for undergraduate classes and researchers.</p>
<p><strong>La Trobe University Herbarium</strong></p>
<p>The La Trobe University Herbarium (LTB) was established in 1967 by geneticist Noel Thurling, who is responsible for many of the early collections. Trevor Whiffin took over the running of the herbarium in 1973 when he began at the university as a lecturer in plant systematics. He kept this role until his retirement in 2008, and most of the collection was developed under his watch.<br />
The majority of the collection is from southern and eastern Australia, with an emphasis on Eucalyptus, Angophora, Acacia, Correa and rainforest plants, including Melastomataceae, Monimiaceae, and Rutaceae (Flindersia). LTB also houses some collections from Papua New Guinea. The herbarium is actively used by researchers and students in the new Department of Ecology, Evolution and Environment, both for teaching and to house vouchers and other new collections.</p>
<p>Until recently, LTB – which contains an estimated 25,000 specimens – had no register or database of specimens. With support from the ALA, and staff at the <a title="NHV" href="http://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/science/herbarium-and-resources/national-herbarium-of-victoria" target="_blank">National Herbarium of Victoria</a>, a <a title="Specify Software" href="http://specifyx.specifysoftware.org/" target="_blank">Specify</a> collections management system was set up and data entry began in 2010, and over<a title="LTB Occurrence Records Map" href="http://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=collection_uid:co33#tab_mapView" target="_blank"> 3,400 specimens</a> have been databased to date. LTB is currently working towards completing the databasing of their eucalypt collection, with funding provided by the Bjarne K Dahl Trust.</p>
