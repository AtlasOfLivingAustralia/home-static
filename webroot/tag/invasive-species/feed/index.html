										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A team of Victorian researchers has analysed data extracted from over three million plant specimens to reconstruct the introduction of invasive plant species into Australia for the first time.</strong></p>
<p>Invasive plants are estimated to cost the Australian economy over $4 billion a year through lost production and increased control costs.  They have also been linked to the extinction of several endangered species.  Understanding how invasive species are introduced into Australia helps put steps in place to prevent them getting here in the first place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://avh.chah.org.au" target="_blank">Australia’s Virtual Herbarium</a> (AVH) brings together specimen data from many of Australia’s herbaria (specialised museums that house collections of dried plants, algae and fungi) and makes it freely available on the web, providing the most complete and up-to-date picture of Australia’s botanical diversity available.</p>
<p>Researchers from a joint project between the University of Melbourne and the Victorian Government used the data stored with each plant specimen to pinpoint where and when species were found in Australia for the first time.  By matching this with information about where else in the world the species was found, and what types of things people used the species for, the researchers were able to estimate the species most likely pathway of introduction into Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_34922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34922" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://images.ala.org.au/image/view/96820178"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-34922" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/AVH2-1.jpg" alt="The first herbarium record of Ulex europaeus (Gorse) from Australia; collected at Studley Park, Melbourne in 1884 by Felix Reader." width="393" height="600" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/AVH2-1.jpg 671w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/08/AVH2-1-197x300.jpg 197w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-34922" class="wp-caption-text">The first herbarium record of <em>Ulex europaeus</em> (Gorse) from Australia; collected at Studley Park, Melbourne in 1884 by Felix Reader.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What we found was that the pathways of introduction have diversified substantially over the last 150 years.  In the early years after European settlement, we saw mostly grasses and legumes used for food or fodder arrive from Europe, whereas the species arriving now come from all corners of the globe for mostly ornamental purposes”, said Aaron Dodd, the lead author of the study.</p>
<p>Large-scale research projects like this one demonstrate the importance of expertly identified, specimen-based records for research and how this information can be used to inform areas other than plant taxonomy.  Such projects have only become possible through the recent digitisation of the physical specimens held by herbaria and the sharing of that information via portals such as AVH and the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a> (ALA).</p>

<p>With access to over 18 existing plant pest collections from around Australia, the APPD provides information on over one million pest voucher specimens making it possible to quickly retrieve details of insects, nematodes, fungi, bacteria and viruses that affect plants of economic and ecological significance. This information is essential in assessing the risks of potentially harmful, exotic organisms; developing emergency plant pest management; as well as supporting important biosecurity research activities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian <a title="Citizen Scientists and the ALA" href="https://www.ala.org.au/get-involved/citizen-science/" target="_blank">Citizen Scientists</a> are busy (like bees!) documenting the spread of an exotic and invasive South African carder bee, <em>Afranthidium Immanthidium repetitum</em>. Through the great work of the <a title="Carder Bee Project" href="Hyperlink:%20http://www.bowerbird.org.au/projects/3426/sightings" target="_blank">BowerBird community</a>, the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a> has learnt that the known distribution for this species has increased significantly. From what was first recorded in Brisbane in 2000, Sydney in 2007, and recent records in Rockhampton and Albury lodged in late 2014.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, Ken Walker from the Victoria Museum has now confirmed a new sighting for the species: in Victoria. The species has well and truly crossed the state borders, and human transportation is the most likely cause for its spread, as explained in this <a title="Carder Bee QLD Factsheet" href="http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Animals+of+Queensland/Insects/Wasps+and+bees/Common+species/Meter-box+Carder+Bee#.VRtsN_yUfpp" target="_blank">Queensland Museum fact sheet</a>.</p>

<p>The <a title="Bee record on BB" href="http://www.bowerbird.org.au/observations/29816" target="_blank">sighted bee</a> was captured, recorded, and uploaded by a member of the public to the <a title="BoweBird" href="http://www.bowerbird.org.au/" target="_blank">BowerBird</a> website for identification on December 8 2014, from the suburb of Kew in Victoria.</p>
<p>The initial image of the male specimen was taken in alcohol, looking down one eyepiece of a microscope with an iPhone – an impressive photograph and certainly good enough for species identification (as there is no native <a title="Megachilidae Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachilidae" target="_blank">megachilid</a> bee in Australia with these distinctive yellow colour markings). The photographed specimen is now in the collection of Museum Victoria.</p>
<figure id="attachment_33972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33972" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-iPhone-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-33972" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-iPhone-1.jpg" alt="A remarkable photograph taken through the lens of a microscope with an iPhone camera; gives great detail, certainly ample for identifying it as the invasive South African carder bee, Afranthidium Immanthidium repetitum Credit: Jessica Baumann" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-iPhone-1.jpg 800w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-iPhone-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-iPhone-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/Carder-Bee-iPhone-1-640x480.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-33972" class="wp-caption-text">A remarkable photograph taken through the lens of a microscope with an iPhone camera; gives great detail, certainly ample for identifying it as the invasive South African carder bee,<em> Afranthidium Immanthidium repetitum</em> Credit: Jessica Baumann</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike many other megachilid bee species, this bee does not nest in the ground or in wooden holes, but rather it makes a “cotton-ball like” free standing nest from “hairs” it gathers from plant leaves and forms its nest inside sheltered locations such as wooden boxes or window frames: making them a perfect candidate for human transportation.</p>
<p>Citizen Science is a very important source of data for Australian biodiversity knowledge. Data and insights gained through the efforts of everyday spotters can be as valuable as that obtained by scientists working in academia, natural history collections, government agencies and business. The new sightings of invasive pests uploaded by citizen scientists are a perfect example of how public knowledge and experiences with the environment around them can assist with issues of national importance, such as biosecurity.</p>
<p>BowerBird is supported by the Atlas of Living Australia and <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/" target="_blank">Museum Victoria</a>. Records provided to and identified by BowerBird users are uploaded to the Atlas of Living Australia each week.</p>
