<p>COG developed an exciting citizen science project, the Gang-gang survey, to enlist the help of the community to collect information about the Gang-gang cockatoo.  Mr Chris Davey, the survey project manager said COG was keen to introduce a wider audience to the fun of birdwatching and spark their interest in learning more about native birds and their habitat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reaching this audience was greatly enabled by the development of the on-line web portal for the survey by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)&#8221; Mr Davey said. Members of the public were able to register and log casual sightings of the Gang-gang in the database.  &#8220;It also helped that the Gang-gang is a charismatic bird, easily-recognised by its squeaky gate call and plumage&#8221; Mr Davey said.</p>
<p>The community response to the survey was outstanding with over 4,000 sightings logged in the ALA database and over 300 on-line participants by the end of the 12 month survey in February 2015. Ms Kathy Eyles, the survey communications manager said &#8220;Most of the survey participants were not COG members and we are excited that for many local people, this was their first foray into citizen science!&#8221;</p>
<p>Positive local media coverage of the survey project and also widespread affection and concern for the Gang-gang Cockatoo provided a focal point for community participation. Ms Eyles said there was plenty of positive feedback from participants. &#8220;We asked observers why they got involved in the survey and most said they were keen to help a project to learn more about the Gang-gang and really enjoyed watching out for these gorgeous birds in their gardens and local reserves&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted to get involved in citizen science &#8211; this is the first time I&#8217;ve been involved!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Survey made my walks more interesting and an interesting bird&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I feel I can help protect them by logging them in the survey&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Gang-gangs are interesting attractive birds and I&#8217;m worried about their decline&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Proud to see them in my garden&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_35914" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35914" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318174517/http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TeganListonIMG_2786ee-300x200.jpeg" alt="Gang-gang" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-35914" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35914" class="wp-caption-text">Gang-gang (image credit: Tegan Liston)</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;Importantly, we were also able to use the feedback from participants to identify a number of survey design and communication lessons for future citizen science projects&#8221; Ms Eyles said.</p>
<p>Mr Chris Davey the survey project manager said, the survey results reveal that the Gang-gang cockatoo has an interesting and non-random distribution within the region. &#8220;In urban Canberra for example, you are more likely to see the Gang-gang in suburbs bordering the forested nature reserves of Mt Majura and Mt Ainslie, Gossan Hill, Bruce and O’Connor Ridges, Black Mountain, Aranda Bushland to the north of Lake Burley Griffin and Red Hill and Mt Taylor to the south&#8221; Mr Davey said.</p>
<p>While the survey provided much needed information on the distribution and behaviour of Gang-gangs, it was not able to provide information on movement patterns that would help determine the number of Gang-gangs in the local region.</p>
<p>COG is now talking with the ANU Fenner School about a doctoral research project to build on the survey results. This research would track movement, possibly using marked birds, to shed light on their movement patterns in the region, and may also involve a breeding study. This means our budding citizen scientists may well be called upon again to help track the Gang-gang Cockatoo.</p>
<p>Copies of the survey reports are available from the Canberra Birds website: <a href="http://canberrabirds.org.au/observing-birds/gang-gang-survey/">http://canberrabirds.org.au/observing-birds/gang-gang-survey/</a></p>

<p>BioBlitzes bring scientists, naturalists, and public volunteers (Citizen Scientists) together to explore and record biodiversity information and learn about local ecological communities. This two day event will have a schools program on Friday and surveys will be happening from before dawn to after dark. Bioblitzes are a great way to be part of large-scale environmental studies within an enjoyable community atmosphere, all while gathering important regional data that can be used for research and giving an opportunity to learn about our natural environment alongside the experts.</p>

<p>The Wallagoot catchment is predominately forest or woodland with cleared land for agriculture, the Wallagoot Lake itself is an <a href="http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fisheries/habitat/aquatic-habitats/wetland/coastal-wetlands/management-of-coastal-lakes-and-lagoons-in-nsw#What-is-an-‘ICOLL’?" target="_blank">ICOLL</a> with seagrass beds and small areas of saltmarsh. There are large areas protected in the Bournda National Park and Bournda Nature Reserve as well as Bega Local Aboriginal Land Council land and property in private ownership.</p>
<p>Several endangered ecological communities and a number of threatened flora and fauna species as well as a number of invasive species can be found in the area. The Kalaru/Wallagoot area is rich in fauna values, especially for the Yellow-bellied Glider, Glossy Black Cockatoo, and threatened shore and water birds. The area is a wildlife corridor allowing species to move between more and less disturbed areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bie.ala.org.au/species/Phascolarctos+cinereus" target="_blank">Koala</a> is one of the most recognizable and celebrated species in Australian fauna, inhabiting Eucalyptus woodlands and forests through out eastern Australia: from the SE South Australia across Victoria, Eastern NSW, and SE QLD. Koalas are one of the few Australian species that feed exclusively on Eucalyptus leaves and are partial to only a few gum tree species (not a highly nutritious or energy rich diet, hence all the sleeping!). The iconic Koala is celebrated in popular culture and are on the must-see list for almost every international tourist visiting Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_35278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35278" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-35278" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2015/10/Celebs-Holding-Koalas-1.jpg" alt="T-Swizzle, Oprah, Obama, Camilla, Harry Styles, Putin, MJ, and Mariah...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Koala populations are being threatened by a number of factors including habitat loss (urban development, fire, and drought) and disease, including a highly infectious <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22207442" target="_blank">strain of </a><em><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22207442" target="_blank">Chlamydia</a>;</em> a sexually transmitted disease which can presents symptoms such as conjunctivitis and genital infections, causing individuals to be weak and vulnerable to other threats (predation, malnutrition, fire, etc.).</p>
<p>Across the Koala range of Australia; conservation groups, ecologists, wildlife organisations, national parks, and government departments are engaging in programs and methods to monitor, protect, and ensure Koalas continue to exist.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/get-involved/citizen-science/" target="_blank">Bioblitzes and Citizen Science projects</a> are a great way to get involved with Koala conservation and research, and the ALA supports a number of community projects which are happening RIGHT NOW! Below is a list of current and ongoing koala-focused projects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="koala-count-2015"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>KOALA COUNT 2015</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>National Parks Association of NSW</strong></p>
<p>Koala Count 2015 is large-scale, national citizen science survey developed by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216163604/http://npansw.org.au/index.php/campaigns/citizen-science/koala-count" target="_blank">National Parks Association of NSW</a> (NPA). The aim of the annual count is to build a comprehensive picture of koala numbers and locations across Australia. This year, they have have partnered with <a href="http://naturemapr.com/">NatureMapr</a> – an innovative public data collection software that brings together nature enthusiasts and conservation experts – to develop a new Koala Count app that makes data collection more robust and helps participants to record sightings more easily. The app is a free GPS enabled software that allows the user to upload sightings directly to the database. This data will then be uploaded to the Atlas of Living Australia.</p>
<p>Koala Count runs from 7-17 November 2015. For more information or to get involved, please visit: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516200533/http://koalacount.org.au/" target="_blank">http://koalacount.org.au/</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/">Australian Museum</a>, developed <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> to harness the power of online volunteers to digitise biodiversity data that is locked up in biodiversity collections, field notebooks and survey sheets. DigiVol has attracted volunteers from all walks of life, and they are proud to announce that the 1000th volunteer has just joined the community!</p>
<p>DigiVol enables volunteers from around the world to transcribe handwritten diaries, scientist notebooks and specimen labels, and identify location data – in turn creating a digital record for physical ones. Through DigiVol, volunteers are helping museums and universities to make their research material available to everyone online. The data has many uses but most important is that it can help scientists and planning officials better understand, utilise, manage and conserve Australia’s precious biodiversity.</p>
<p>Paul Flemons is Head of Citizen Science at Australia Museum and the manager of DigiVol, he explains “DigiVol enables the public to contribute to the process of scientific discovery in a way never previously possible. This is invaluable to museums in a time of scarce government funding.”</p>
<p>Each DigiVol project is called an Expedition and can contain a number of pages or specimens that need to be transcribed into a digital version. Megan Edey as the largest contributor to DigiVol has completed over 40,000 tasks! Megan explains more about her work “I like doing both the insect and the diary expeditions on DigiVol. I especially liked working on the Edgar Waite diaries and following his life story. DigiVol is interspersed throughout my day, I sometimes log on in between doing the washing or feeding the horses or whenever the family are watching something boring on TV!  I can be logged on for between 2 and 5 hours a day.”</p>

<p>The unique volunteer experience is explained in this <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/blogpost/science/transcriptions-molluscs">Australian Museum blog</a> &#8220;Different volunteers enjoy different tasks, with some of them becoming obsessed with the lives of the diary writers, others with transcribing insect labels. All of their efforts are captured in the DigiVol Honour Board where they aspire to be a Weekly Wonder, Monthly Maestro or DigiVol Legend by transcribing the most tasks weekly, monthly and overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>DigiVol and its capability to assist with the enormous task of digitising their collections  is not restricted to Australia’s museums and collections either;  institutions like the <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/institution/index/4940813" target="_blank">Smithsonian</a>, <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/2277905" target="_blank">New York Botanic Gardens</a>, and <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/4725119" target="_blank">Kew Gardens</a> have also chosen DigiVol to host their own virtual expeditions to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.botany.unimelb.edu.au/herbarium/" target="_blank">University of Melbourne Herbarium</a> is the latest collection institution to join in the DigiVol effort, with their <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/7314225" target="_blank">first expedition</a> focusing on legume specimens from the Burnley Horticultural College.</p>
<p>If you’d like to get involved and join DigiVol, simply head to <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">www.volunteer.ala.org.au</a> and there&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/181836918595085/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> too. Happy transcribing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month (11-17 May 2015) marked <a href="http://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/national-volunteer-week-2015/" target="_blank">National Volunteer Week</a>, a week dedicated to celebrating and thanking the 6 million Australian volunteers who spend their time enriching and improving Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s biodiversity knowledge and conservation is strongly supported and powered by volunteers, with plenty of people choosing to spend their time in the great outdoors; improving, protecting, and promoting our unique ecosystems. Biodiversity volunteers aren&#8217;t just out in the bush though. Many help behind-the-scenes in our museums, galleries, herbariums, and collections. People from all walks of life are getting involved in the enormous effort to digitise the vast collections of records and specimens held by such institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldwide, an estimated five million invertebrate species are yet to be described, according to the<em><a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/node/13866" target="_blank"> Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World</a></em>.  Invertebrates – animals without a backbone or vertebral column – are the most abundant group of animals on earth and yet they are the least documented. In Australia alone there are around 98,000 described species and an estimated 222,000 that are still unknown to science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The South Australian Museum holds around two million specimens in its terrestrial invertebrate collection and around 1.75 million marine invertebrates. The Museum has begun a digitisation program to help address this backlog, and their doing this vital work using the Atlas of Living Australia and Australian Museum developed <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While National Volunteer Week concludes for another year, the volunteering efforts to transform biological expedition diaries and specimen tags never ends. If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, please visit our <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol volunteer page </a> and best of all you don&#8217;t even need to leave the house to join in the fun of transcription!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">With summer almost here, now is the perfect time to get out of the house and enjoy Australia’s great outdoors. And what better way to do it than by joining one of the citizen science events that are happening across the country this November! Not only will you be out enjoying nature, but you’ll be making a valuable contribution to Australia’s biodiversity knowledge as well, with recorded sightings being fed into the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a>(ALA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Events include the <a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.alcw.org.au/mimosa-rocks-bioblitz-ready-to-roll/" target="_blank">Mimosa Rocks BioBlitz</a>, which is taking place on the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> of November; the <a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/research/bioblitz.htm" target="_blank">World Parks Congress BioBlitz</a>, which will be held in Sydney on Sunday November 16<sup>th</sup>; and the <a href="http://koalacount.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/npansw/home.htm" target="_blank">National Koala Count</a>, which will run from the 7<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th</sup> of November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The picturesque Mimosa Rocks National Park is located on the NSW south coast and is home to an amazing array of flora and fauna, including Potaroos, Glossy Black-cockatoos, orchids, and cycads to name just a few. The Mimosa Rocks BioBlitz will include 43 surveys hosted by expert scientists and naturalists. For more information, including what surveys are happening when and how to register, please visit <a href="http://www.alcw.org.au/mimosa-rocks-bioblitz-ready-to-roll/" target="_blank">www.alcw.org.au</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">The World Parks Congress (WPC) BioBlitz is happening as part of <a href="http://www.worldparkscongress.org/involved/social_planetfest.html" target="_blank">PlanetFest</a>, and, with the help of families and nature lovers, aims to capture a snapshot of the biodiversity at Sydney Olympic Park. Experts will take participants on guided nature surveys where they’ll go hunting for birds, insects, plants, frogs and water bugs. There will be hands on displays in the BioBlitz marquee, providing the opportunity to learn more about BioBlitz events and how they assist protected area managers to involve the public in scientific surveys. For more information and to register for the event, please visit <a href="http://wpcbioblitz.eventbrite.com.au" target="_blank">http://wpcbioblitz.eventbrite.com.au</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Both the Mimosa Rocks and WPC BioBlitz events are using the international product, <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>, to register sightings. These records will be incorporated into the ALA on a regular basis.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_32740" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32740" style="width: 316px" class="wp-caption alignright"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/calling-all-citizen-scientists/attachment/istock_000019042302xlarge_reduced/" rel="attachment wp-att-32740"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-32740  " title="Two koalas sitting on a branch" src="http://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/iStock_000019042302XLarge_REDUCED-316x210.jpg" alt="Two koalas sitting on a branch" width="316" height="210" /></a></span><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32740" class="wp-caption-text">Join the fun of the National Koala Count and help us better understand these furry friends.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And for those who aren’t in NSW, why not take part in the National Koala Count, which is open to participants across Australia. A freely-available, GPS-enabled smartphone app, BioTag, has been developed especially for the event by the ALA. The app allows participants to easily record their koala sightings anywhere across the country. BioTag is available for both android and Apple mobile devices and can be downloaded from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=biotag&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google play</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/itunes/" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, just search for BioTag. People who do not own a smartphone or tablet can enter their sightings directly into the <a href="http://koalacount.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/npansw/home.htm?signin=true" target="_blank">National Parks Association’s Data Portal</a>. To get involved, simply register at <a href="http://koalacount.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/npansw/home.htm" target="_blank">www.koalacount.org.au</a>, download BioTag, or log onto the <a href="http://koalacount.ala.org.au/bdrs-core/npansw/home.htm?signin=true" target="_blank">Data Portal</a>, and you are ready to start counting!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">By participating in any (or all!) of these events you will be helping to build a more comprehensive picture of the numbers and locations of Australian plant and animal species across the landscape, which is highly important for the effective management of our precious and unique biodiversity.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> is a collaboration between the <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/" target="_blank">Australian Museum</a> and the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a> that was initially an experimental foray into crowd-sourcing. At the time, the notion that there were online volunteers willing to help natural history collections capture their data seemed rather far-fetched.</p>

<p>It was definitely a risk: crowd-sourcing was in its infancy and there were no other museums providing online volunteers with an opportunity to help digitise their natural history collections. But now, DigiVol has not only become a means for Australia’s museums to tackle the enormous task of digitising their collections, but institutions like the Smithsonian, New York Botanic Gardens, and Kew Gardens have also chosen DigiVol to host their own virtual expeditions to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>As further proof of DigiVol’s success, we recently recorded two impressive milestones. Our volunteers at <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol Online </a>have now completed over 100,000 transcription tasks, with some of our most prolific volunteers completing over 10,000 transcription tasks each. Also, in just two short years, <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/Rapid-Digitisation-Project" target="_blank">DigiVol Lab</a> volunteers at the Australian Museum have created over 70,000 images of the Museum’s very large Malacology (think molluscs, such as snails, slugs, clams, octopus and squid) collection. These milestones represent a monumental contribution to digitising the collections of museums and herbaria from Australia and around the world.</p>

<p>Spot whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef without leaving your loungeroom with a new virtual expedition on the Atlas of Living Australia Biodiversity Volunteer Portal. The expedition enables participants to get involved in whale shark conservation by transcribing the daily reports of spotter planes over Ningaloo Reef. The virtual expedition is one of a number on the Biodiversity Volunteer Portal which was developed by the Atlas of Living Australia, in collaboration with the Australian Museum, to harness the power of online volunteers.</p>
<p>Team Lead of the Volunteer Portal, Paul Flemons, said volunteers – or ‘citizen scientists’ – taking part in this latest expedition will help provide critical information on this vulnerable species. “ECOCEAN, a scientific charitable group dedicated to whale shark conservation, have provided the daily spotter plane records that we are asking volunteers to transcribe,” he said. “Having these records digitised and available in an online database means scientists, conservation agencies and government departments across the country can work together to help conserve this gentle giant.”</p>
<p>Volunteers can take part in this, and other virtual expeditions, by simply logging onto the Volunteer Portal and registering their details. Mr Flemons said more than 200 volunteer transcribers have signed up already but more are needed to take part in the growing number of virtual expeditions and digitisation projects available on the site. “We are working with other Australian museums, as well as some leading overseas institutions, to create virtual expeditions that engage volunteers who are passionate about natural history and willing to dedicate a little of their time to helping to preserve it” he said. Mr Flemons said the volunteers are vital for helping to capture the wealth of information hidden in natural history collections, field notebooks and survey sheets not only in Australia but around the world. “The transcribed information will be used for better understanding, managing and conserving our precious biodiversity.”</p>
