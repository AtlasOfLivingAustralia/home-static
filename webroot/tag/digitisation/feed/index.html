										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/">Australian Museum</a>, developed <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> to harness the power of online volunteers to digitise biodiversity data that is locked up in biodiversity collections, field notebooks and survey sheets. DigiVol has attracted volunteers from all walks of life, and they are proud to announce that the 1000th volunteer has just joined the community!</p>
<p>DigiVol enables volunteers from around the world to transcribe handwritten diaries, scientist notebooks and specimen labels, and identify location data – in turn creating a digital record for physical ones. Through DigiVol, volunteers are helping museums and universities to make their research material available to everyone online. The data has many uses but most important is that it can help scientists and planning officials better understand, utilise, manage and conserve Australia’s precious biodiversity.</p>
<p>Paul Flemons is Head of Citizen Science at Australia Museum and the manager of DigiVol, he explains “DigiVol enables the public to contribute to the process of scientific discovery in a way never previously possible. This is invaluable to museums in a time of scarce government funding.”</p>
<p>Each DigiVol project is called an Expedition and can contain a number of pages or specimens that need to be transcribed into a digital version. Megan Edey as the largest contributor to DigiVol has completed over 40,000 tasks! Megan explains more about her work “I like doing both the insect and the diary expeditions on DigiVol. I especially liked working on the Edgar Waite diaries and following his life story. DigiVol is interspersed throughout my day, I sometimes log on in between doing the washing or feeding the horses or whenever the family are watching something boring on TV!  I can be logged on for between 2 and 5 hours a day.”</p>

He accompanied various trawling expeditions in the Pacific and sub-Antarctic and wrote of his work in diaries now housed in the Australian Museum Archives Collection.</p>
<p>The unique volunteer experience is explained in this <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/blogpost/science/transcriptions-molluscs">Australian Museum blog</a> &#8220;Different volunteers enjoy different tasks, with some of them becoming obsessed with the lives of the diary writers, others with transcribing insect labels. All of their efforts are captured in the DigiVol Honour Board where they aspire to be a Weekly Wonder, Monthly Maestro or DigiVol Legend by transcribing the most tasks weekly, monthly and overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>DigiVol and its capability to assist with the enormous task of digitising their collections  is not restricted to Australia’s museums and collections either;  institutions like the <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/institution/index/4940813" target="_blank">Smithsonian</a>, <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/2277905" target="_blank">New York Botanic Gardens</a>, and <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/4725119" target="_blank">Kew Gardens</a> have also chosen DigiVol to host their own virtual expeditions to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.botany.unimelb.edu.au/herbarium/" target="_blank">University of Melbourne Herbarium</a> is the latest collection institution to join in the DigiVol effort, with their <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/project/index/7314225" target="_blank">first expedition</a> focusing on legume specimens from the Burnley Horticultural College.</p>
<p>If you’d like to get involved and join DigiVol, simply head to <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">www.volunteer.ala.org.au</a> and there&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/181836918595085/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> too. Happy transcribing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During April 13-17 2015, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and <a href="http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Collections" target="_blank">CSIRO</a> hosted an international summit focused on data sharing and strategies for leveraging common digitisation practices and protocols. This event grew from conversations and interactions after an iDigBio Summit in November of 2014 between the ALA, <a href="http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Collections/ANIC" target="_blank">Australian National Insect Collection</a> (ANIC), a representative from China’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180106143416/http://www.nsii.org.cn:80/" target="_blank">National Specimen Information Infrastructure of China</a> (NSII), and the <a href="https://www.idigbio.org/" target="_blank">iDigBio</a> team from the USA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do we mean by &#8220;digitisation&#8221; and why is it important? Digitisation is the act of creating a digital record for an existing physical one. For example, transcribing hand-written specimen tags or photographing old expedition diaries into digital and searchable resources. Digitisation ensures that fragile physical collections be preserved long-term; reducing physical handling of items which would cause deterioration over time or even loss. Allowing these digital versions to be available online is important to global biodiversity research; eliminating the requirement to visit a collection in person, these resources become available to anyone, anytime, anywhere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Representatives from across Australia and around the globe converged on the CSIRO Black Mountain site in Canberra to share their knowledge, experience, and thoughts on issues such as: data sharing, digitisation techniques, imaging, new technologies, data visualisation, outreach, public participation, and project management. Participants also had a chance to tour some of the CSIRO collections that are held in Canberra: <a href="http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Collections/ANWC" target="_blank">Australian National Wildlife Collection</a>, Australian National Insect Collection, and neighbouring <a href="https://www.anbg.gov.au/gardens/" target="_blank">Australian National Botanic Gardens</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month (11-17 May 2015) marked <a href="http://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/national-volunteer-week-2015/" target="_blank">National Volunteer Week</a>, a week dedicated to celebrating and thanking the 6 million Australian volunteers who spend their time enriching and improving Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s biodiversity knowledge and conservation is strongly supported and powered by volunteers, with plenty of people choosing to spend their time in the great outdoors; improving, protecting, and promoting our unique ecosystems. Biodiversity volunteers aren&#8217;t just out in the bush though. Many help behind-the-scenes in our museums, galleries, herbariums, and collections. People from all walks of life are getting involved in the enormous effort to digitise the vast collections of records and specimens held by such institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldwide, an estimated five million invertebrate species are yet to be described, according to the<em><a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/node/13866" target="_blank"> Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World</a></em>.  Invertebrates – animals without a backbone or vertebral column – are the most abundant group of animals on earth and yet they are the least documented. In Australia alone there are around 98,000 described species and an estimated 222,000 that are still unknown to science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The South Australian Museum holds around two million specimens in its terrestrial invertebrate collection and around 1.75 million marine invertebrates. The Museum has begun a digitisation program to help address this backlog, and their doing this vital work using the Atlas of Living Australia and Australian Museum developed <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While National Volunteer Week concludes for another year, the volunteering efforts to transform biological expedition diaries and specimen tags never ends. If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved, please visit our <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol volunteer page </a> and best of all you don&#8217;t even need to leave the house to join in the fun of transcription!</p>

<p>The specimens held by Australia’s natural history collections underpin our knowledge of Australia’s biodiversity. What sets collections-based records apart from other (mostly observational) records in the ALA is that they are all based on preserved specimens housed in museums and herbaria. These specimens provide a permanent record of the occurrence of a species at a particular place and time, and are the primary resource for research on the classification and distribution of Australian plants, animals and fungi.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the data is based on physical specimens that can be re-examined, the identification of suspect records can be checked and the data can be kept up to date as species concepts change, and as our understanding of Australia’s biodiversity improves. They can also document changes in individual species through time: specimens collected in the past may present traits that differ slightly from what can be seen in the wild today. Museums and herbaria also house specimens of species that are now extinct in the wild, sometimes providing the only physical evidence that a species ever existed!</p>

<p>Specimen records are important for scientific research, and natural history collections are critical references for scientists from a vast breadth of the biological and environmental science disciplines. For example, researchers used museum paleontological specimens, preserved skeleton DNA and contemporary DNA to prove that the <a href="http://bie.ala.org.au/species/Sula+dactylatra+tasmani#tab_gallery" target="_blank">Tasman Booby</a>, a bird <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114125252/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090811-extinct-booby-masked.html" target="_blank">believed to be extinct</a>, was still living on islands in the North Tasman Sea (<a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/94" target="_blank">Steeves <em>et al</em>. 2010</a>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the collecting data associated with a specimen is made visible on the ALA website, it is accessible to the entire world: geographical impediments to closer investigation are minimised.<br />
Along with the collecting of data, high quality images of specimens are increasingly becoming available through the ALA. This allows researchers to investigate specimens from all over Australia – often in microscopic detail. As well as making access to collections data much easier, aggregating the specimen data from multiple collections in the one place allows researchers to investigate biodiversity in new ways.</p>

<p>Collections-based data are being enthusiastically used by the research community right now – scientific researchers, ecological researchers, and conservation management/planning have been the largest groups of users. The 10 million+ records from natural history collections in the ALA have been part of almost 140,000 separate download events in the last 12 months, totalling more than 550 million data points downloaded.<br />
The 10 millionth record was provided by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (<a href="http://www.magnt.net.au/" target="_blank">MAGNT</a>), who are just one of the many collections who are regularly contributing to the ALA database.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol</a> is a collaboration between the <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/" target="_blank">Australian Museum</a> and the <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">Atlas of Living Australia</a> that was initially an experimental foray into crowd-sourcing. At the time, the notion that there were online volunteers willing to help natural history collections capture their data seemed rather far-fetched.</p>

<p>It was definitely a risk: crowd-sourcing was in its infancy and there were no other museums providing online volunteers with an opportunity to help digitise their natural history collections. But now, DigiVol has not only become a means for Australia’s museums to tackle the enormous task of digitising their collections, but institutions like the Smithsonian, New York Botanic Gardens, and Kew Gardens have also chosen DigiVol to host their own virtual expeditions to digitise their collections.</p>
<p>As further proof of DigiVol’s success, we recently recorded two impressive milestones. Our volunteers at <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank">DigiVol Online </a>have now completed over 100,000 transcription tasks, with some of our most prolific volunteers completing over 10,000 transcription tasks each. Also, in just two short years, <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/Rapid-Digitisation-Project" target="_blank">DigiVol Lab</a> volunteers at the Australian Museum have created over 70,000 images of the Museum’s very large Malacology (think molluscs, such as snails, slugs, clams, octopus and squid) collection. These milestones represent a monumental contribution to digitising the collections of museums and herbaria from Australia and around the world.</p>
