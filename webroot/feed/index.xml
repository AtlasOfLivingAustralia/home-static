<p>A fishy new software package will help researchers share data more easily with the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).</p>



<p><a href="https://galaxias.ala.org.au/">{galaxias}, a new R and Python package</a>, makes it easier than ever for researchers to bundle data and metadata for sharing.</p>



<p>Martin Westgate, ALA Science &amp; Decision Support Team Lead, says a huge amount of biodiversity data is generated by long-term ecological research run out of universities.</p>



<p>“This data is very rich, so it has a lot of structure to tell us how things are changing over time, and it&#8217;s expertly derived,” Martin said.</p>



<p>“People are storing this data, publishing it and sometimes providing it to state governments as part of their permit requirements.</p>



<p>“But it&#8217;s not making its way into public data fora, so we felt that the story of biodiversity data in Australia wasn&#8217;t as complete as it might be.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="going-with-the-flow-swimming-with-research-workflows">Going with the flow: swimming with research workflows</h2>



<p>Dax Kellie, ALA’s Science Program Lead and a co-author of galaxias, says the team designed galaxias with a research workflow in mind.</p>



<p>It’s targeted at researchers with data that they&#8217;ve collected and worked with that they might want to share.</p>



<p>galaxias uses code many researchers already know and use for preparing, analysing and visualising their data. The idea is to empower researchers to manage their own data as the experts in their data.</p>



<p>“It gives researchers the agency to standardise their data themselves,” Dax said.</p>



<p>“So it makes data sharing simple and fast, and it does it in a language that most researchers are familiar with.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="when-you-fish-upon-a-star-formatting-data-for-sharing">When you fish upon a star: formatting data for sharing</h2>



<p>galaxias simplifies the process of converting biodiversity data into the <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/">Darwin Core Archives (DwCA) format</a>. This format enables sharing of biodiversity data by standardising identifying features, taxonomic classification and data definitions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="844" height="512" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/10/Spotted-Galaxias_Zacky-N_cropped.jpeg" alt="A small spotted galaxias fish in a clear plastic box" class="wp-image-50963" style="width:374px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/10/Spotted-Galaxias_Zacky-N_cropped.jpeg 844w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/10/Spotted-Galaxias_Zacky-N_cropped-300x182.jpeg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/10/Spotted-Galaxias_Zacky-N_cropped-768x466.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The <a href="https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/cf102dd4-54dd-4f2d-a438-21ab5931a009">Spotted Galaxias</a> (<em><a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https:/biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/e4d85845-3e34-4112-90a9-f954176721ec">Galaxias truttaceus</a></em>) is found across southern Victoria, Tasmania, and south-west Western Australia. Credit: Zacky, CC BY-NC</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“I guess the challenge or the technical problem that galaxias solves is that no one knows what our data format is,” Martin said.</p>



<p>“People will be collecting data of the same type &#8211; I saw this species on this day in this place &#8211; but using their own data structures, their own databases and their own mechanisms.”</p>



<p>galaxias makes it easy for users to convert their data to a universal standard, including ways to:<br>• standardise observational data<br>• write metadata<br>• validate minimum requirements for data sharing<br>• publish data and metadata.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left" class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left" id="some-fin-to-celebrate">Some-fin to celebrate</h2>



<p>The name “<a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https%3A/biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/cf9d20e7-5234-4ff3-94a2-23802357365f">galaxias</a>” comes from a genus of small native fish found in rivers, lakes and streams <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https%3A/biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/cf9d20e7-5234-4ff3-94a2-23802357365f">across most of Australia</a>.</p>



<p>They’re small and rarely seen, and two-thirds of Australia’s Galaxias species are <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/607ec6ae-18b6-43e8-9e02-23f946aabdf7">vulnerable </a>or <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/e34d1659-1a1b-4d85-842e-3665edf32938">endangered</a>, so they could do with some publicity!</p>



<p>“galaxias is the partner package to <a href="https://galah.ala.org.au/">galah</a>—galaxias gets data in, galah gets data out. So there&#8217;s a real circle there in where galaxias fits into the ALA universe,” Dax says.</p>



<p>“And, like ‘galah’, ‘galaxias’ is the name of an Australian native animal containing our acronym ‘ALA’.”</p>



<p>Galaxias are important members of their freshwater ecosystems and great indicators of ecosystem health, but many are quite delicate and easy to overlook.</p>



<p>Similarly, the ALA’s new galaxias software package aims to play an important role in the open research data ecosystem.</p>

<p>Sharing this stream of research data makes for a richer data ecosystem for biodiversity information in Australia.</p>



<p>“Sharing data means that researchers get to influence policy and get to influence the conservation of the species they’re working on&#8211;because suddenly that information is available more widely to environmental consultants,” Martin says.</p>



<p>“And the data will be available for other researchers, so they may generate insights that hadn’t been considered.”</p>



<p>Sharing data also provides the opportunity for greater insight because data from many different sources can be used to give a more comprehensive picture on the environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="feedback-welcome">Feedback welcome</h2>



<p>Our ultimate goal is to make the process of preparing data in Darwin Core simple and stress-free, encouraging more people to share data. If you choose to try galaxias, we’d appreciate any feedback about your experience so we can make Galaxias better!</p>



<p>Feedback can be sent to support@ala.org.au or reported as an issue on the<a href="https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galaxias/issues"> R package GitHub page </a>or <a href="https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galaxias-python/issues">Python package GitHub page</a>.</p>



<p>”This is early days and we don&#8217;t know exactly what the best package will be,” Dax said.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re very flexible at this stage and happy to amend or adjust, which we&#8217;ve done before with galah.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of potential here if this works to implement it more as a point and click interface too. So the more people who use it, the better; and we can build it together.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A new dataset sees verified images from wildlife camera traps available in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) through the Wildlife Observatory of Australia (WildObs).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new dataset sees verified images from wildlife camera traps available in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).</p>



<p>But it wasn’t just a case of point and shoot to incorporate this new data into the ALA.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wildobs.org.au/">Wildlife Observatory of Australia</a> (WildObs) is a national initiative transforming how Australia collects, processes, and shares <a href="https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dp5214">data from wildlife camera traps</a>. WildObs is a partnership led by the <a href="https://www.qcif.edu.au/">Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation</a> (QCIF) and supported by our NCRIS colleagues the <a href="https://www.tern.org.au/">Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring Network</a> (TERN) and the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/the-wildlife-observatory-of-australia-wildobs/">Australian Research Data Commons</a> (ARDC).</p>



<p>For our part, the ALA developed a new process for ingesting data in <a href="https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org/">Camera Trap Data Package</a> (CamtrapDP), a new standard that allows richer data capture specifying deployments, observations and media. It’s been developed by the <a href="https://www.tdwg.org/">Biodiversity Information Standards organisation (TDWG)</a> and adopted by the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a> (GBIF). The ALA transforms Camtrap data into <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/">Darwin Core </a>events and occurrences.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_brush-turkey_day_CLOSE-UP_resize-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-50819" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_brush-turkey_day_CLOSE-UP_resize-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_brush-turkey_day_CLOSE-UP_resize-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_brush-turkey_day_CLOSE-UP_resize-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_brush-turkey_day_CLOSE-UP_resize.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Australian Brush Turkey (<em>Alectura lathami</em>). Identified by Zachary Amir, CC BY-NC</figcaption></figure>



<p>WildObs works across many research projects to curate verified camera trap datasets, and we’ve collaborated with them to mobilise data using CamtrapDP. This then allows the ALA to provide the infrastructure behind the <a href="https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dp5214">WildObs Tagged Image Repository</a> and makes the camera trap data <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/resource-hub/making-data-fair/">findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable</a> (FAIR).</p>



<p>The ALA’s normal data processing pipeline prepares the data for indexing and mapping. We match records to our taxonomic backbone, and standardise dates and times and coordinates. We track globally unique identifiers for the records and datasets, and we apply threatened species statuses and responsibly manage obfuscation and access to sensitive records.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_cassowary_close-up_resize-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-50820" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_cassowary_close-up_resize-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_cassowary_close-up_resize-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_cassowary_close-up_resize-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_cassowary_close-up_resize-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/Camera-trap_cassowary_close-up_resize.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius</em>), Identified by Zachary Amir, CC BY-NC</figcaption></figure>



<p>Peggy Newman is the ALA’s Data Manager.</p>



<p>&#8220;The ALA’s ingestion pipeline is ideal for handling most of the standardisation and data cleaning needed to produce AI-ready datasets, which is often the most time consuming and mind numbing part of building AI/ML models,&#8221; Peggy says.</p>



<p>“In the coming years, we’re expecting to see a huge influx of biodiversity datasets like this where the observations and identifications come about from automation and modelling.</p>



<p>“For the models to get better, they’ll need to be built with and informed by openly shared and verified datasets. When the models are better, they’ll be able to help produce better quality datasets in shorter timeframes.</p>

<p>Plants are the third biggest type of occurrence record in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), with over 24 million occurrence records. And scientific collections have a big role to play in helping to tackle plant diseases.</p>



<p>We recently participated in the <a href="https://www.appsnet.org/">Australasian Plant Pathology Society</a> conference: From Field to Future, Scientific Collections and Plant Pathology.</p>



<p>As part of this, we offered bursaries to support university students and early career researchers to attend the conference. We spoke with three of them to find out their perspectives on the future of plant disease science and the role of online platforms like the ALA.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="966" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/APPP-bursaries-image_cropped-1024x966.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-50792" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/APPP-bursaries-image_cropped-1024x966.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/APPP-bursaries-image_cropped-300x283.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/APPP-bursaries-image_cropped-768x724.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/APPP-bursaries-image_cropped-1536x1449.jpg 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/APPP-bursaries-image_cropped-2048x1932.jpg 2048w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/09/APPP-bursaries-image_cropped-1920x1811.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="haixia-guan-phd-candidate-the-university-of-sydney">Haixia Guan, PhD candidate, The University of Sydney</h2>



<p>Haixia is interested in the evolutionary ’arms race’ between plants and pathogens, and how genome-scale data can be used to better understand disease dynamics. In her PhD she explored the evolution and virulence variation of crown rust pathogens of Australia using comparative genomics and population-level variation analysis.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="did-you-already-know-about-the-atlas-of-living-australia">Did you already know about the Atlas of Living Australia?</h4>



<p>I was aware of the ALA but hadn’t used it widely. Attending APPS 2025 gave me the opportunity to further understand the scope and potential of the ALA, especially in terms of integrating species distribution data with environmental and genomic data.</p>



<p>I realised that the ALA could be a valuable tool for planning field sampling strategies and for relating pathogen occurrence to environmental variables.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="what-did-you-most-enjoy-learning-more-about-at-the-conference">What did you most enjoy learning more about at the conference?</h4>



<p>I enjoyed most the diversity of research topics and the opportunity to interact with researchers working in different areas of plant pathology &#8211; and understanding species diversity and evolution from a genomic perspective.</p>



<p>An unexpected but inspiring moment was learning how open data platforms and other bioinformatics resources are being used to maintain biological diversity and systematically monitor plant pathogens.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="where-do-you-see-yourself-working-studying-in-plant-pathology-in-the-future-and-what-do-you-see-as-the-role-of-online-data-platforms-like-the-atlas-of-living-australia">Where do you see yourself working/studying in plant pathology in the future? And what do you see as the role of online data platforms like the Atlas of Living Australia?</h4>



<p>In the future, I hope to continue working in fungal pathogen genomics, ideally combining computational biology and field-based studies to address key questions about disease surveillance and management.</p>



<p>Online data platforms like the ALA play a crucial role in this context. They offer an incredible foundation for integrative analyses—linking species distribution, environmental data, and temporal changes. For researchers, platforms like ALA democratise access to biodiversity data and support more informed, large-scale plant epidemiology studies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="arundhati-singh-phd-candidate-curtin-university">Arundhati Singh, PhD Candidate, Curtin University</h2>



<p>Arundhati is interested in fungicide research. In her PhD, she’s specifically investigating the spatial and temporal dynamics of fungicide distribution within plants and how these influence disease control and the development of resistance.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="did-you-already-know-about-the-atlas-of-living-australia">Did you already know about the Atlas of Living Australia?</h4>



<p>Yes, I’m familiar with the ALA. While I haven’t contributed occurrence records yet, I’ve used the platform to review species distributions and understand local biodiversity for understanding the background of my experiments.</p>



<p>As my current work focuses on fungicide distribution and its role in disease management, tools like the ALA offer an excellent opportunity to connect biological datasets with plant pathology research. I’m looking forward to exploring it further as my research expands into more field-based components.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="what-did-you-most-enjoy-learning-more-about-at-the-conference">What did you most enjoy learning more about at the conference?</h4>



<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the sessions on integrated disease management and pathogen evolution. It was especially inspiring to see how molecular techniques are being integrated with field-based approaches to develop more sustainable plant disease control strategies.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="where-do-you-see-yourself-working-studying-in-plant-pathology-in-the-future-and-what-do-you-see-as-the-role-of-online-data-platforms-like-the-atlas-of-living-australia">Where do you see yourself working/studying in plant pathology in the future? And what do you see as the role of online data platforms like the Atlas of Living Australia?</h4>



<p>I hope to continue in academia, focusing on research that bridges fundamental laboratory science with applied, field-based strategies to develop targeted and sustainable plant protection methods.</p>



<p>I see platforms like the ALA playing an increasingly vital role in this work; offering accessible, reliable biodiversity data that can inform disease risk assessments, support research planning, and enhance biosecurity efforts.</p>



<p>I also believe integrating such platforms into both research and teaching will be critical in training the next generation of plant pathologists.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="alyssa-martino-scientific-officer-biodiversity-research-research-centre-for-ecosystem-resilience">Alyssa Martino, Scientific Officer Biodiversity Research, Research Centre for Ecosystem Resilience</h2>



<p>Alyssa’s research focuses on forest pathology, in particular host resistance to the fungal pathogen <em>Austropuccinia psidii</em> which causes myrtle rust. This has involved investigating disease resistance genes in Australian native trees, which are highly diverse both within and between species. It’s sparked a broader interest in researching disease resistance gene evolution, and gene diversity across native plant populations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="did-you-already-know-about-the-atlas-of-living-australia">Did you already know about the Atlas of Living Australia?</h4>



<p>Yes, I am familiar with the platform and have used it both during my PhD and now during my postdoc. During my PhD, I established the<a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/projects/gum-tree-guardians"> Gum Tree Guardians project </a>on iNaturalist as a citizen scientist initiative to increase awareness of myrtle rust in Australia.</p>



<p>I was fortunate to collaborate with Erin Roger and the ALA and Rebecca Paxton from the University of Adelaide on a broader <a href="https://theconversation.com/myrtle-rust-is-lethal-to-australian-plants-could-citizen-scientists-help-track-its-spread-225681">myrtle rust campaign</a> to boost the total myrtle rust observations in ALA.</p>



<p>I also use the ALA platform (especially the spatial portal) in my postdoc role. Based at the Sydney Botanic Gardens within the <a href="https://www.botanicgardens.org.au/our-science/what-we-do/research-centre-ecosystem-resilience">Research Centre for Ecosystem Resilience</a>, I work on the population genetics of threatened plant species across NSW. The <a href="https://spatial.ala.org.au/">spatial portal</a> has been a great tool for planning collections of these species across the state.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="what-did-you-most-enjoy-learning-more-about-at-the-conference">What did you most enjoy learning more about at the conference?</h4>



<p>The conference was incredibly inspiring! Having recently started my first postdoc, based at the Sydney Botanic Gardens, the conference theme of collections sparked a lot of ideas for future research, especially seeing research using herbarium specimens to uncover the history, evolution, and diversity of plant pathogens.</p>



<p>I was amazed to see the preservation of fungal spores on herbarium specimens, making me think about what may be lurking in the Sydney Botanic Gardens collections.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left" class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left" id="where-do-you-see-yourself-working-studying-in-plant-pathology-in-the-future-and-what-do-you-see-as-the-role-of-online-data-platforms-like-the-atlas-of-living-australia">Where do you see yourself working/studying in plant pathology in the future? And what do you see as the role of online data platforms like the Atlas of Living Australia?</h4>



<p>Being born and raised in Western Australia, I see myself one day taking the learnings from my time in Sydney back to Perth or Albany. My goal is to bring high-quality plant pathology research down to the south-west biodiversity hotspot in Western Australia, with a focus on investigating disease resistance gene diversity in WA’s endemic plant species.</p>



<p>Platforms like the ALA will assist ahead of fieldwork for collections, and will also enable the collection of data on plants and pathogens during this type of research. It will be incredibly beneficial in a biodiversity hotspot which is threatened by plant pathogens like<em> Phytophthora cinnamomi</em>, which has already had a large impact in that region.</p>

<p>Our former biosecurity lead <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/erin-roger-9299a067">Dr Erin Roger</a> delivered a conference keynote address on how open data research infrastructure can support data driven biosecurity initiatives.</p>



<p>“Our <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/biosecurity/">Biosecurity Alerts Service</a>, based largely on citizen science data, can detect and report invasive species throughout Australia. It can support the plant pathology sector by monitoring the spread of plant pests and diseases, such as myrtle rust,” Erin said.</p>



<p>“We’ve also been improving data quality and taxonomic representation for the benefit of plant pathology. For example, we’ve greatly expanded ALA representation of biosecurity relevant species via our <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/abdmp/">data mobilisation program</a>.”</p>

<p>Supporting the next generation to gain hands-on experience in STEM fields is critical to engaging and inspiring our future researchers and data scientists. That&#8217;s why, each year, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) offers several internship positions with our science and support teams.<br></p>



<p>We chatted with our recent 2025 Summer students, Yaohang, Jarod and Jeff to find out more about their ALA internship experience and what they’ve learned along the way.</p>

<p><strong>1. What&#8217;s your study background?<br></strong>I am an international student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). I’m in my final year and I have always had an interest in software and cloud technologies. Throughout my studies, I’ve gained a solid foundation in programming, software and engineering, and I’m really excited to apply my academic knowledge to practical environment and real-world projects.<br></p>



<p><strong>2. What was the topic you chose to focus on? What factors led you to choose this topic?<br></strong>I chose to focus on DevOps engineering, which involved migrating the ALA’s Restricted Access Species Data system’s deployment process. I chose this one because it involves continuous integration and continuous delivery and cloud technologies. My interest in cloud computing and automation, along with the opportunity to work on real-world problems related to my major, made this topic quite interesting for me. Although I’m interested in other topics as well, this one suited me the best for my background.<br></p>



<p><strong>3. What’s a new skill that you learned through the program?<br></strong>I gained valuable experience with cloud technologies, particularly in using infrastructure-as-code solutions that aligns with ALA’s workflow and developed much deeper understanding of different use cases of cloud services and best practice of cloud native technology when building out the infrastructure.<br>I also learned a lot about DevOps and approaches to managing infrastructure. There’s always a gap between learning it from documentation and then applying that to a project. I’m also impressed how ALA manage all the infrastructure and services efficiently.<br></p>



<p><strong>4. What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?<br></strong>One challenge I encountered was differences between two tools we used when migrating the deployment process of API. The existing tool Pulumi made things simple by letting me set up the API with just a few basic settings, but it is highly abstracted. When I switched to using our internal technologies, it provided a more detailed and fine-grained control—I had to manually set up several pieces and make sure they all worked together. At one point, I missed a step, which led to a significant amount of time spent troubleshooting the issue. It was a real learning experience in paying attention to details and troubleshooting issues.<br></p>



<p><strong>5. What was the highlight of your internship experience?<br></strong>The highlight of my internship was successfully completing the system migration with minimal downtime. It was rewarding to see the deployment go smoothly, especially after the long preparation during this summer.<br>Working with my team at ALA was a fantastic experience. Everyone was incredibly supportive, and I learned so much from their expertise—especially from my mentor, Joe. Their guidance helped me apply ALA’s best practices while recreating the infrastructure, allowing us to fully automate the process when setting up and tearing down different environments.</p>

<p><strong>1. What’s your study background?<br></strong>My background is a mix of computer science and science. I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Science majoring in Ecology and Conservation Biology, with previous studies majoring in Computer Science.<br></p>



<p><strong>2. What was the topic you chose to focus on? What factors led you to choose this topic?<br></strong>I looked at the impact that the Black Summer bushfires had on Southern Greater Gliders (Petauroides volans) distribution. As a proud Wodi Wodi man, I am deeply interested in understanding how megafires like the Black Summer fires have impacted biodiversity and species distribution in Australia, especially so given the wide scale prevention of the community from continuing traditional fire regimes on the east coast of Australia since colonisation.<br></p>



<p><strong>3. What’s a new skill that that you learned through the program?<br></strong>Species distribution modelling is the biggest skill I learnt! It was a lot of fun and really eye opening to learn about, being able to go out and find data to analyse, and then to produce a species distribution map was a very enjoyable experience and it was very rewarding to produce that final output.<br></p>



<p><strong>4. What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?<br></strong>Managing spatial data and pushing the limits of what my computer could handle was the biggest challenge. The spatial data I was working with is quite big, and modelling is computationally intensive, so it often took a while to run and crashes were frequent, which made debugging and producing the final result a very long but ultimately rewarding experience.<br></p>



<p><strong>5. What was the highlight of your internship experience?<br></strong>The highlight of my internship was definitely getting to know the Science and Decision Support team and working closely with them, whilst spending my summer developing my R skills on a topic that I am very passionate about.</p>

<p><strong>1. What’s your study background?<br></strong>I study Information Systems at UNSW.<br></p>



<p><strong>2. What was the topic you chose to focus on? What factors led you to choose this topic?<br></strong>The topic of focus involves gathering user requirements to redesign the user interface of ALA’s Profile Collections site. I chose this topic because I have a keen interest in UX/UI and business analysis, and this topic was perfect for me to apply these skills that I learned in university.<br></p>



<p><strong>3. What’s a new skill that you learned through the program?<br></strong>A new skill that I earned through the program was interviewing people. Before this internship, I had never interviewed anyone before, so naturally, I wouldn’t know how to structure an interview or how to ask questions effectively. Through the guidance of my supervisor and buddy in this project, I was able to learn the key techniques and methods of interviewing people, as well as what questions to ask in order to get the most insights out of people.<br></p>



<p><strong>4. What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?<br></strong>The biggest challenge I encountered during this internship was that I had to work remotely away from my supervisors. Personally, I enjoy collaborating face-to-face with people as it allows for more interactive discussions and immediate feedback.<br></p>



<p><strong>5. What was the highlight of your internship experience?<br></strong>The highlight of my internship would have to be meeting so many amazing people from within ALA. Even though most of us are based in different locations, I was still able to chat and have meaningful conversations with many of my colleagues. Additionally, my colleagues in the Sydney office have been super kind and welcoming to me since day one, which made my internship experience a whole lot better.</p>

<p>While some species have millions of observations recorded in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), many lesser-known species have few or even no public records. The ALA has been working to improve taxonomic representativeness of our data with a little help from the international community!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="927" height="1024" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/03/orchid-927x1024.png" alt="close up of two orchid flowers on a single plant.

<p>So how do we get more rare records? Species specimens from museums or herbaria are invaluable sources for this task. The thing is, getting access to specimen data isn&#8217;t always easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One challenge stems from a strength of taxonomy: It&#8217;s a global discipline. Natural history specimens are sent around the world to experts for careful description and classification. This means that specimens, including those of Australian species, can end up anywhere on the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another challenge is getting access to specimen data. Digitising specimens helps to make important specimens discoverable by end users. Museums and herbaria face a vast task in digitising their collections, and even though Australia is one of the leading countries in this respect, when there are only one or two existing specimens of a species in the world, it can be difficult to even find these amidst the ocean of specimens awaiting digitisation!&nbsp;</p>



<p>While progress continues to be made digitising the global backlog, it is important to also gather existing lesser-known datasets with <em>digitised </em>specimen data – digitally catalogued physical specimens, photographs or sounds (and metadata about the place and time they were recorded). People often don&#8217;t think to look in international digital specimen datasets for data on Australian species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ALA is fortunate to partner with the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a> (GBIF), an international repository of many regional and national <a href="https://living-atlases.gbif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living Atlases</a> like the ALA. From GBIF, the ALA was able to source an additional three million records of Australian species to the ALA&#8217;s 150 million records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These additional records have provided the first digital records of a whopping 7,914 Australian species. Another 6,177 had the number of records doubled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/03/gecko.jpg" alt="close up of a gecko with large golden eyes, and mottled yellow and brown body" class="wp-image-50405" style="width:751px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/03/gecko.jpg 800w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/03/gecko-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2025/03/gecko-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gulbaru Gecko (<em>Phyllurus gulbaru</em>), photo credit: dhfischer CC-BY</figcaption></figure>



<p>The result is even more exciting for threatened species. These GBIF data have contributed more than 72,703 records of 1,393 federally threatened species! Crucially, GBIF data has contributed records for 482 data-poor species (species with less than 80 records). For another seven threatened species, these data provided their first Australian digital records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Improving the taxonomic breadth of Australian species records in the ALA is incredibly important for both science and conservation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>More species with openly accessible data means scientists can save time and effort searching for data, having positive impacts on conservation assessments and modelling.&nbsp;</p>
