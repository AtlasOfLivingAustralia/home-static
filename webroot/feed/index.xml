										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After launching internationally in 2008, iNaturalist has blossomed into one of the most popular citizen science platforms in the world with more than 214 million observations across approximately 491,000 species, contributed by almost 3.4 million users (<a>as of October 2024). </a></p>



<p>While these are incredible collective results, it’s safe to say our local iNaturalist Australia node is a heavyweight on the global stage and, as a major contributor to Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) records, we’re celebrating a big milestone this month with iNaturalist Australia’s fifth birthday!</p>



<p><strong>iNaturalist Australia beginnings</strong></p>



<p>Although Australian observations on iNaturalist date <a>all the way back to </a><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/245">2008</a>, things were slow going for the first eight years. Records started to accumulate faster in late-2016 after the creation of the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/australasian-fishes"><em>Australasian Fishes</em> project</a>, but it wasn’t until late-2019 that things really took off. This kickstart to the exponential rise of observations for Australia was no coincidence: it marked the official launch of iNaturalist Australia as a node of the iNaturalist Network, with the local node run by the ALA.</p>



<p>To celebrate this five-year anniversary, we’ve summarised just some of what the iNaturalist community in Australia has achieved.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="724" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/iNat-usage-1024x724.jpg" alt="Graph showing total Australian iNaturalist observations over time, rising from under 1 million before 2020 to over 8 million by mid 2023." class="wp-image-50032" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/iNat-usage-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/iNat-usage-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/iNat-usage-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/iNat-usage.jpg 1379w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Total Australian iNaturalist observations over time. Since June, this figure has now surpassed 9 million records!</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>



<p><strong>Some quick statistics</strong></p>



<p>Australia is one of the most significant contributors to iNaturalist globally, punching well above our weight relative to our population. We rank third in the world for the number of observations, second for the number of species (behind only the United States), and first in the southern hemisphere across all key metrics. As of <a>October 2024</a>, there are <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6744,7333,7616,10287,10293,118147">more than 9 million Australian observations on the platform</a> across approximately 60,000 species, contributed by 100,000 users. Importantly, more than 34,000 users have contributed identifications to Australian iNaturalist observations.</p>



<p>The most observed Australian species is the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6744,7333,7616,10287,10293,118147&amp;taxon_id=8575">Australian Magpie, with almost 35,000 observations</a>, followed by the Laughing Kookaburra, Koala, Superb Fairywren and Rainbow Lorikeet. The most observed major group, however, is <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6744,7333,7616,10287,10293,118147&amp;iconic_taxa=Plantae">plants with 2.85 million observations</a>, followed closely by <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6744,7333,7616,10287,10293,118147&amp;iconic_taxa=Insecta">insects with 2.51 million observations</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="845" height="1024" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/inat-selection-845x1024.jpg" alt="A gallery of iNaturalist photos" class="wp-image-50036" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/inat-selection-845x1024.jpg 845w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/inat-selection-248x300.jpg 248w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/inat-selection-768x931.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/inat-selection-1268x1536.jpg 1268w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/inat-selection.jpg 1322w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Why was the ALA-iNaturalist Australia partnership so important?</strong></p>



<p>By hosting iNaturalist Australia, the ALA sparked greater recruitment of two key demographics. First, more observers joined the platform, accelerating the accumulation of records. It took six years for Australia to reach 10,000 total iNaturalist records from 2008─2014 but now more than 10,000 new Australian records are uploaded to the platform <strong>every single day</strong>, and the number of observations uploaded to the site continues to grow exponentially. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Second, the ALA’s support of iNaturalist prompted many more experts to join the platform and contribute their expertise and knowledge, which has been <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001843">crucial for improving data quality</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How is your data being used?</strong></p>



<p>iNaturalist data are used extensively in conservation planning, land management, and thousands of scientific journal papers around the globe. In Australia, iNaturalist records feed directly into the ALA, allowing researchers all around the country to access the data at any time. Australian iNaturalist records are being used for a wide range of exciting and important research, including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720358770?casa_token=-R-YI0mMMCoAAAAA:RzC-t2Qr07fBLAh6s6_kV_hRlFRNhk8ynNfBOSIASjEckHcfTTywlp5XLkmA39qzxurqTg">understanding the effects of bushfires on biodiversity</a>, <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR24046">monitoring species of biosecurity concern</a>, <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v688/p167-172/">quantifying habitat composition from images</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381433/">rediscovering long unobserved species</a>, and <a href="https://mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.5380.3.1">even discovering, and facilitating the description of, undescribed genera and species</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How can I get involved?</strong></p>



<p>You can use iNaturalist through <a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/">a browser on your computer</a><a href="#_msocom_6"> </a>or via the mobile phone app: check out <a href="https://ala.org.au/publications/a-guide-to-inaturalist/">our in-depth guide</a> to get you started. iNaturalist Australia is the fastest growing citizen science platform in the country, so there’s no better time to join than now! The achievements to date have all been thanks to the dedicated and passionate people observing, identifying and curating observations of Australia’s amazing biodiversity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The ALA's Data Profile has been updated for better search results]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a>When using the Atlas of Living Australia&#8217;s occurrence search, our Data Profile tool</a> filters out potentially problematic records to lift the visibility of higher quality data. We&#8217;re changing it to filter iNaturalist records that are verifiable but haven&#8217;t yet been verified by default.</p>



<p>iNaturalist Australia is one of the largest and most up to date datasets in the ALA. As of September 2024, <a href="https://collections.ala.org.au/public/show/dr1411">more than 7.5 million iNaturalist records</a> are loaded into the ALA, with tens of thousands of new records every week.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1821" height="1365" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/red-tooth-brushes-grevillea-hookeriana-thebeachcomber-CCBY-edited.jpeg" alt="close up view of brushlike grevillea flowers" class="wp-image-50009" style="width:405px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/red-tooth-brushes-grevillea-hookeriana-thebeachcomber-CCBY-edited.jpeg 1821w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/red-tooth-brushes-grevillea-hookeriana-thebeachcomber-CCBY-edited-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/red-tooth-brushes-grevillea-hookeriana-thebeachcomber-CCBY-edited-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/red-tooth-brushes-grevillea-hookeriana-thebeachcomber-CCBY-edited-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/red-tooth-brushes-grevillea-hookeriana-thebeachcomber-CCBY-edited-1536x1151.jpeg 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/red-tooth-brushes-grevillea-hookeriana-thebeachcomber-CCBY-edited-640x480.jpeg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1821px) 100vw, 1821px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Red tooth brushes (<em>Grevillea hookeriana</em>) Credit: thebeachcomber CC-BY</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The ALA accepts two main types of verifiable record from iNaturalist: &#8216;Research Grade&#8217; and &#8216;Needs ID&#8217;. While this will continue to be the case a new ALA data profile update means only Research Grade records will now be shown by default on maps and in search results.</p>



<p><a>A third category is &#8216;Casual&#8217;, which includes records of cultivated plants, records missing important metadata such as the date and/or location, and records with no evidence of the organism. The ALA does not ingest Casual records. </a></p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="why-did-we-make-this-change">Why did we make this change?</h2>



<p>Although the identification accuracy of Needs ID iNaturalist records is still relatively high for many groups of organisms (see for example, <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/blog/94061-observation-accuracy-experiment-v0-4-is-underway">the most recent accuracy experiment run by iNaturalist staff</a>), a number of recent studies <a>(including some major work in preparation on iNaturalist records of Western Australian plants</a>) have shown that Research Grade records have a higher identification accuracy than Needs ID records for most taxa. Filtering Research Grade records in the ALA by default therefore maximises data quality for all users.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-difference-between-needs-id-and-research-grade">What is the difference between Needs ID and Research Grade?</h2>



<p>When an observation is first uploaded to iNaturalist, it is designated as &#8216;Needs ID&#8217;. The entry will remain in this category while it only has a single identification at species-level or finer or is identified to a rank coarser than species.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="841" height="966" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/pic1-1.png" alt="a record page with species name, needs ID flag, photos and one suggested identification" class="wp-image-49993" style="width:600px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/pic1-1.png 841w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/pic1-1-261x300.png 261w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/pic1-1-768x882.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /></figure>



<p>This iNaturalist record is currently categorised as Needs ID as it only has a single identification attached to it.</p>



<p><a>Broadly speaking, ob</a>servations will shift from Needs ID to Research Grade when at least two identifications have been added (including the observer&#8217;s original identification), the community ID is at a species-level or finer, and more than two-thirds of identifiers agree on the identification (two from two, three from three, three from four, four from five, and so on). Research Grade observations can shift back to Needs ID at any time based on new identifications.</p>



<p>For a more detailed explanation of these grades, refer to pages 27-28 of <em><a href="https://ala.org.au/publications/a-guide-to-inaturalist/">A Guide to iNaturalist: An Australian Perspective</a></em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="761" height="1024" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/pic2-761x1024.png" alt="a record page with species name, research grade flag, photos and two suggested identifications " class="wp-image-49991" style="width:600px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/pic2-761x1024.png 761w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/pic2-223x300.png 223w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/pic2-768x1034.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/09/pic2.png 853w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /></figure>



<p>This iNaturalist record is currently Research Grade, as it has two identifications at a species level which both agree with each other.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="what-change-has-the-ala-made">What change has the ALA made?</h2>



<p>In the ALA, these Research Grade and Needs ID categories are represented in the Darwin Core field <em>identificationVerificationStatus</em>. The change to the default Data Profile, called &#8220;ALA General&#8221;, now excludes all Needs ID iNaturalist records by default on maps and in search results with a newly established <a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000240256-getting-started-with-the-data-quality-filters">group</a>: &#8216;Exclude unverified records&#8217;. This profile is visible at the top of any page of occurrence records in the ALA.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="can-i-still-view-these-needs-id-records">Can I still view these Needs ID records?</h2>



<p>Needs ID records are still retrievable at any time. All you have to do is untick the checkbox next to the data profile, and the records will then be included in your results.

<p>Access to high-quality biodiversity data is more essential than ever in understanding and responding to changes in our natural environment. This information is used for informing planning, policy and decision-making and delivering research. Through the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), more than 135 million species occurrence records are available as open data, with rich information accompanying these records such as images, location, spatial, genetic and related data.</p>



<p>By enhancing traditional methods to monitor species with novel technologies, a more comprehensive view of Australia’s biodiversity can be developed. To celebrate Biodiversity Month in September, hear from three speakers as they discuss their use of ecoacoustics, eDNA and camera trapping as innovative methods to enhance our ability to detect and monitor biodiversity in Australia.</p>



<p>The ALA receives support from the Australian Government through the <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/ncris">National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy</a> (NCRIS) and is hosted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/">CSIRO</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ALA’s new book – Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Why did we publish this book?</strong></p>

<p>Tidying messy data can be difficult, but it is a task that anybody who works with data must face if they want to use data to tackle scientific questions!</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) Science &amp; Decision Team recently authored a book titled&nbsp;<a href="https://cleaning-data-r.ala.org.au/">Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</a>. This free resource provides up-to-date information on data cleaning processes for anybody who handles their data using code in R. As Australia’s national biodiversity database, the ALA is frequently asked questions about the best way to clean data using code.&nbsp; To provide advice on this topic, our first step was to investigate what the currently accepted “best” way might be. We deep-dived into multiple recent peer-reviewed research to see whether experts cleaned their biodiversity data in the same way.</p>
</div>

</div>



<p>Through this process we discovered that the steps to clean ecological data can be really messy! Even among experts, data cleaning can look completely different depending on the type of investigation and study species. No wonder people ask how to do it!</p>



<p>This book is our response to questions about how to clean biodiversity data in R. The book provides guidance on many of the processes for cleaning biodiversity data.</p>

<p><strong>What’s covered in the book and who is it for?</strong></p>



<p>In <em>Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</em>, we provide an overview of a typical biodiversity data cleaning workflow for open-access geo-referenced biodiversity data—from acquisition, to error identification, to correction. These processes are broken down into sections on exploring data, general data cleaning, and data cleaning processes that require expertise in your study species. The book has information suited to those just starting out working with biodiversity using R, to those who are looking for more advanced techniques.</p>

<p>Welcome to the July 2024 edition of our Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) newsletter.</p>



<p>In this issue, we are excited to release our <a href="https://ala.org.au/publications/ala-annual-work-plan-2024-2025/">2024-25 ALA Annual Workplan</a> which is a key element of our strategic and operational planning process. Priorities in the workplan are informed by<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/publications/ala-strategy-2020-2025/"> ALA’s Strategy 2020–2025</a>, operational priorities that may emerge in any year, and partnerships that the ALA has commenced establishing. The workplan acts as both an internal planning tool to guide team priorities, and for external communication purposes to provide our stakeholders with greater visibility into ALA operations.</p>



<p>2024-25 will be the fifth year of delivery under the ALA’s current strategy. Priorities will include the production release of several important initiatives that commenced 2023-24, including the (a) operational national biosecurity alerts service, (b) new ALA home page, species pages and global search interface under the UX/UI project, and (c) stage two of the taxonomic architecture project which will include improved species names matching. Collectively, these capabilities will be transformational for Australia’s biodiversity data community, and we look forward to their release. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As a national research infrastructure supported under the NCRIS program, partnerships are fundamental to how the ALA benefits Australia’s researchers, decision-makers and community. In 2024-25, the ALA will further partner with Australia’s biological collections sector and to develop a case to support a <a href="https://ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/06/Accelerating_Discovery_and_Access_to_Australias_Biological_Collections_2024_June.pdf">national approach to biological collections</a> akin to the major programs currently underway in Europe and the United States. Beyond the biological collections sector, the ALA will improve the reach and depth of its partnerships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, working more closely with Indigenous ranger programs to co-design and deliver training programs to enhance the utility of the ALA. Similarly, this year we established a number of partnerships with the environmental consulting sector given the critical role they play in assessing and monitoring Australia’s biodiversity, and we plan to extend these partnerships to support improved translation of research infrastructure to industry.</p>



<p>Our workplan also identifies project leads from the ALA, and we encourage you to reach out to our team to learn more or to collaborate. I hope you enjoy reading our July 2024 Newsletter. </p>



<p><strong>Dr Andre Zerger, ALA Director.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/abdmp/">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program</a> (ABDMP) was developed to promote and improve the scientific understanding of Australia’s rare and remarkable biodiversity. In our third year of the program, the ABDMP was expanded to include both a ‘general’ funding stream and a ‘biosecurity-specific’ funding stream. Through a competitive application process, we are pleased to announce the successful biosecurity projects for 2024. The general round of projects will be announced shortly.</p>



<p><strong>Successful Biosecurity Projects:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><a href="https://nre.tas.gov.au/biosecurity-tasmania">Biosecurity Tasmania</a>:</strong> This project will mobilise more than 73,000 invertebrate specimen records from the Tasmanian Agriculture Invertebrate Collection (TAIC). This includes more than 450 type specimens and unique records from Macquarie Island.  Cumulatively these records will provide a significant increase in spatial areas of many Tasmanian species not currently represented in the ALA, accelerating the documentation of Australia’s invertebrate fauna.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.dbca.wa.gov.au/science/research-tools-and-repositories/western-australian-herbarium"><strong>Western Australian Herbarium –</strong> <strong>Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions</strong></a><strong>.</strong> To improve the detection of invasive plants across Western Australia, this project will capture high-resolution images of herbarium specimens and mobilise this information to the ALA.  These images, along with existing data for 36,700 specimens and an additional 800 to be digitised, will be made publicly available. This will greatly improve the ability of land managers and biosecurity groups to identify and manage invasive species.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><a href="https://pir.sa.gov.au/research">Primary Industries and Regions South Australia- South Australia Research and Development Institute (SARDI)- Aquatic and Livestock Sciences</a>.</strong> SARDI holds valuable data on invasive, introduced, and native marine species collected in South Australia and beyond. Currently, these records (particularly those for invasive species) are inaccessible to the public. This project will mobilise this data by extracting it from SARDI databases, ensuring quality control, and making it open access through the ALA.</li>
</ul>



<p>We congratulate the successful biosecurity projects for 2024 and thank our review panel for their time and expertise in evaluating many high-calibre applications for this funding stream.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Did you know that small bodies of water in your city, like ponds or retention basins, play a crucial role in the environment? These urban wetlands are vital for supporting clean water, healthy ecosystems, and even bird migration. However, urban wetlands are often highly modified or constructed bodies of water, and are therefore seen as less “valuable” from an urban planning lens in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a partnership between the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), the <a href="https://aurin.org.au/">Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN)</a>, <a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">BirdLife Australia</a> and <a href="https://federation.edu.au/">Federation University</a>, a tool was created to raise awareness of the importance of wetlands in urban environments. The team used open-source citizen-science data to quantify the values of urban wetlands across Victoria, including those that have previously been overlooked. This information was collated into a publicly available online mapping tool, ‘<ins><a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/">Valuing Urban Wetlands</a></ins>’.</p>



<p><strong>The online tool</strong></p>



<p>The tool integrates waterbird and landscape data through an online portal called ‘<a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/"><em>Valuing Urban Wetlands</em></a><em>.</em>’ Waterbird data collected through citizen science and professional science was accessed via the ALA, <a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">BirdLife Australia</a> and <a href="https://ebird.org/region/AU">eBird</a> and overlayed with open landscape data to create metrics for assessing wetland health and importance. The tool focuses on the Greater Melbourne region, but the methodology can be applied to other regions in the future</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="506" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-1024x506.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-49504" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-1024x506.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-768x379.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-1536x759.jpg 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-2048x1012.jpg 2048w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-1920x949.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/">Valuing Urban Wetlands</a> online tool interface.</p>



<p>Anyone can access the <ins><a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/">Valuing Urban Wetlands</a></ins> online portal. You can enter a wetland name or scroll across the map to zoom into an area and click on a wetland of interest to generate an area report. The report will provide a list of all frog and waterbird species present at this wetland (based on the data sources listed above) as well as the number of threatened species for these taxa.</p>

<p><strong>Case study: Latham’s Snipe <em>(<a href="https://www.birdsinbackyards.net/Charadriiformes/Scolopacidae/Gallinago/Gallinago-hardwickii">Gallinago hardwickii</a>)</em></strong></p>



<p>Latham&#8217;s Snipe is a migratory shorebird that relies on wetland habitats. It breeds in Japan and migrates to Australia for the non-breeding season. It is a cryptic bird and difficult to observe, but research has revealed very high numbers of snipe in some Victorian urban wetlands. Through the online tool developed through this project, wetlands important to support Latham’s Snipe are identified and annual numbers recorded at these wetlands are included in wetland report.</p>



<p><strong>Project Impacts</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Raise awareness of urban wetlands:</strong> The project has created a publicly accessible online system that highlights the importance of urban wetlands for biodiversity conservation. This can raise awareness among policymakers, planners, and the general public to give greater consideration to urban wetlands are resources of high biodiversity value. </li>



<li><strong>Improved decision-making:</strong> By providing quantitative data on the value of urban wetlands, the project can inform better decision-making related to land use and development. This ultimately is aimed to lead to better protection of these crucial habitats.</li>



<li><strong>Standardised metrics</strong>: The project has developed a standardised metrics based on citizen-science data for assessing urban wetland value. These metrics can facilitate comparisons across different wetlands and regions.</li>



<li><strong>Citizen science integration: </strong>The project incorporates data from citizen science initiatives like the ALA, Birdlife Australia and eBird. This can empower citizen scientists and contribute valuable data for conservation efforts.</li>



<li><strong>Improved monitoring of key bird species:</strong> Using the Latham&#8217;s Snipe as a case study, this project demonstrates the potential for improving understanding of declining species&#8217; distribution and habitat use in urban areas.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>”Wetlands in urban areas are often overlooked in protection efforts due to a misconception that they are weedy, littered swamps that have low conservation value. However, they provide important refuge habitat for a range of species in our cities, including the Vulnerable Latham’s Snipe. We developed this tool to help raise awareness of the biodiversity value of small urban wetlands by presenting snapshots of data recorded by citizen scientists,</em>” said Dr Birgita Hansen, Project Lead and Senior Research Fellow at Federation University. </p>
