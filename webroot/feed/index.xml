					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the October 2023 edition of our ALA newsletter.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>It’s been an exciting month for the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), CSIRO and our national partners as we welcomed the world’s biodiversity data community to Hobart and Canberra for a series of conferences, meetings and symposia. Our journey began by hosting this year’s annual meeting of the biodiversity data standards group <a href="https://tdwg2023.zohobackstage.com.au/TDWG2023">TDWG</a> in Hobart from October 9<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup>. The event welcomed 166 participants from 26 countries (with 143 joining virtually) to present, learn and connect. We are grateful to those who continue the work of TDWG and biodiversity data standards. The TDWG-maintained Darwin Core standard has underpinned so many of the world&#8217;s biodiversity data systems, including the ALA, and ensures interoperable biodiversity data can move freely across platforms and borders. Events such as the TDWG annual meeting are fundamental in supporting the evolution of the standard and learning about the biodiversity science and applications it enables. <br><br>TDWG was a timely precursor to our next series of events hosted in Canberra and framed around the two-day Governing Board meeting of the <a href="https://gb30.gbif.org/">Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).</a> Australia last hosted the fourth Governing Board meeting (GB04) in 2002 at the National Academy of Sciences and then welcomed 18 countries to Canberra. 21 years later, we hosted 45 people from 30 countries at the National Portrait Gallery and CSIRO (with a further 28 participants joining online from 12 countries) to govern, support and grow the GBIF network. We were pleased to be joined by the Honourable Minister for the Environment and Water Tanya Plibersek at the gala dinner hosted at the National Museum of Australia. <a href="https://minister.dcceew.gov.au/plibersek/speeches/speech-global-diversity-information-facility-gala-dinner" data-type="link" data-id="https://minister.dcceew.gov.au/plibersek/speeches/speech-global-diversity-information-facility-gala-dinner">The Minister&#8217;s address</a> affirmed the importance of data in supporting national and international biodiversity policy priorities and the ALA looks forward to working with our international and national partners to support these. <br><br>Hosting this series of international meetings highlights the leadership role that Australia plays, and the ALA is grateful to the individuals and teams that have put such a strong foundation in place over more than a decade. These partnerships also highlight the importance of international collaboration in improving the national biodiversity data landscape, and ultimately our ability to understand, conserve and enhance the world’s biodiversity. I’m grateful to our team and our fellow CSIRO colleagues who played such an important role in hosting and welcoming our international guests to Australia.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>As Australia’s national biodiversity data infrastructure, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is committed to providing reliable and secure data access to our users. In line with this commitment, we are excited to announce our transition to OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, which will help to streamline the process for accessing data within the ALA across multiple platforms.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-oidc">What is OIDC?</h2>



<p>With OIDC, you can log in to multiple platforms using a single set of sign-in credentials while ensuring that your personal information is secure and private.</p>



<p>OIDC is an identity layer built on top of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://oauth.net/2/" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a> protocol. It&#8217;s designed to facilitate secure authentication and single sign-on (SSO) across different applications and services. If you’d like to read more about how OIDC works with OAuth 2.0, see OpenID Foundation&#8217;s article on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/" target="_blank">how OpenID Connect works</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/" target="_blank">.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-1024x858.png" alt="the layers of how OIDC works. when a HTTP request is sent, OAuth2.0 checks for authorisation access permissions, and OIDC checks for user identity" class="wp-image-48868" style="object-fit:contain;width:633px;height:531px" width="633" height="531" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-1024x858.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-300x251.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-768x644.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-1536x1288.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1.png 1880w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="why-oidc">Why OIDC?</h2>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="enhanced-security"><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3>



<p>One of the key drivers behind ALA&#8217;s adoption of OpenID Connect (OIDC) is its ability to enhance data security.</p>



<p>OIDC operates by employing secure tokens in the background to validate a user&#8217;s identity. These tokens are designed to be short-lived and encrypted, ensuring that your credentials remain protected and reducing the potential for unauthorised access or data breaches.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="seamless-user-experience"><strong>Seamless User Experience</strong></h3>



<p>We’re committed to improving your experience across the ALA site; while this includes features like navigation, readability and look and feel, it also relates to login experience and performance. OIDC enhances our current SSO capabilities, allowing you to log in once to access multiple services without repeatedly entering your credentials.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="federated-sign-in"><strong>Federated sign-in</strong></h3>



<p>OIDC also enhances federated identity services. This means that you can continue to leverage your existing accounts from trusted identity providers such as the <a href="https://aaf.edu.au/">Australian Access Federation</a> (AAF), eliminating the need to create another username and password – making it quicker and easier to access the ALA for existing AAF users.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="scalability-and-integration"><strong>Scalability and Integration</strong></h3>



<p>As the number of records in the ALA grows, we ensure that our systems are flexible and scalable. OIDC allows us to integrate with a variety of web applications and evolve alongside other technical advancements.</p>



<p>Collaboration is also a big part of what we do at the ALA, so we can continue to make even more data findable and accessible. With the growing adoption of OIDC, integration is made easier with our data partners and other collaborators. For example, we are working with <a href="https://www.tern.org.au/">TERN</a> to integrate OIDC, making it quicker and easier for our <a href="https://fieldcapture.ala.org.au/">MERIT</a> users to sign in and submit data to the MERIT system using the TERN Monitor application.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="summary">Summary</h2>



<p>The adoption of OIDC authentication represents a significant milestone in the ALA’s ongoing commitment to data security, performance, and user experience. We remain dedicated to staying at the forefront of technology to do so, and we look forward to continued growth and collaboration with our user community. The ALA has more exciting infrastructure and technology changes coming soon – watch this space!</p>



<p>If you would like to know more about how OIDC benefits your data access experience, please reach out at <a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Celebrating #WorldCassowaryDay]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Err&#8230; is that a bird or a dinosaur?</p>



<p>Well, both (kind of)! We’re talking about the <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https:/biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/5fc1b9fe-ccdd-4c3a-adfc-6f6e5c5c396b">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius</em></a>), often described as one of the closest living relatives of dinosaurs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-Tom-Hunt-CC-BY-NC-819x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48810" style="width:1000px;height:1024px" width="1000" height="1024"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius</em>) adult. Photo Credit Tom Hunt CC BY NC</figcaption></figure>



<p>These gigantic flightless birds (‘ratites’) occupy tropical areas of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. Cassowaries are the second heaviest birds in the world (after ostriches), with females reaching a maximum weight of 55kgs and males up to 76kgs! They lay bright green eggs, with dads stepping up to be in charge of incubation and chick rearing. Once the eggs hatch, baby cassowaries can walk almost immediately with their strong back legs. Babies are not born with their signature black plumage, instead have banded yellow and brown striped patterning as chicks. </p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="967" height="649" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48811" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC.jpg 967w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC-768x515.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius</em>) chick.

<p><strong>Keep your distance</strong></p>



<p>You&#8217;ll often hear these big birds before you see them! Cassowaries are notorious for communicating through deep rumbles, hisses and grunting sounds. Cassowaries use various vocalisations to communicate through their dense rainforest habitats. If you hear a cassowary calling, make sure you keep your distance. Equipped with a razor-sharp beak, talons and a particularly territorial nature, cassowaries are more than capable of tearing through flesh if they feel threatened. </p>



<p><strong>Keystone species</strong></p>



<p>Cassowaries are ‘keystone species’ &#8211; species which has a disproportionately important role in their natural ecosystems. In rainforest habitats across northern QLD, cassowaries play a critical role in dispersing many native seeds through fragmented rainforest landscapes. Due to their large size, cassowaries can swallow fruits and other plants whole, digest the pulp and excrete seeds intact in dung piles (aka natural fertilisers). This ability to disperse large seeds helps to maintain healthy ecosystems by promoting vegetation regeneration.</p>



<p>To better illustrate how cassowaries support native plant dispersal across rainforest ecosystems, Callum and Shandiya from the ALA Science and Decision Support team have created an interactive map. The map shows 15 native plant species across the QLD wet tropics against cassowary records in the ALA!</p>

<p>To celebrate National Science Week 2023, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) hosted three free virtual events. Our events aimed to ignite curiosity, foster learning, and deepen connection with biological sciences and the environment.</p>



<p>Whether you were able to join us on the day and want to catch-up on the content, or if you weren&#8217;t able to make it, we&#8217;ve got you covered with recordings of our three events.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>15th August 2023 &#8211; {galah} 101 Beginners guide</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="ALA Workshop: galah 101 Beginner&#039;s guide – National Science Week – 15 Aug 2023" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YY63sqKfEM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Check out the slides from Dr Dax Kellie and Dr Amanda Buyan <a href="https://acbuyan.quarto.pub/galah-101-beginners-guide/">here</a></p>



<p>Are you interested in getting the most out of data in the ALA? We’ve developed the ALA {galah} tool to&nbsp;enable users to deep-dive and transform species occurrence information. Whether you want to locate and download species records, investigate taxonomic information and associated media such as images or sounds, or restrict queries to certain taxa or locations, {galah} can do it all! This tool has been developed for both the R-Studio and Python coding languages.</p>



<p>Our beginner-friendly workshop introduces a step-by-step introduction to using both {galah} for R-Studio and Python</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>16th August 2023 &#8211; All is F.A.I.R. in open science and data</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="ALA Webinar: All is F.A.I.R in open science &amp; data – National Science Week – 16 Aug 2023" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp_jF8Zxyxc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Open science is the practice of making scientific knowledge, research and information accessible. As Australia’s national biodiversity data aggregator, we explore why open science is so important to delivering strong biodiversity outcomes.</p>



<p>Hear ALA team members Ely Wallis, Peggy Newman and Dax Kellie discuss:</p>



<ul>
<li>How the F.A.I.R. (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles are used through copyright and licencing in the ALA</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>How the ALA supports open science through its data infrastructure and services</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>How open science facilitates transparent, robust research.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>17th August 2023 &#8211; Maximising your metadata for citizen science</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="ALA Webinar – Maximising your metadata for citizen science – National Science Week – 17 Aug 2023" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XU-62h4Q-Zs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Citizen science is an accessible gateway for anybody to engage in science regardless of age, location or demographic. Integrated citizen science apps take in millions of species occurrence records each year, which are then verified before being fed through to the ALA to become open and accessible data.</p>



<p>Hear from Dr Erin Roger and Cam Slatyer from the ALA, Thomas Mesaglio from iNaturalist and Dr Jasmin Packer from the FungiMap Project discuss what makes a great species observation record, and learn tips and tricks for collecting the best quality metadata – data about data. Higher quality metadata (attributes like location, images, date of collection, etc.) helps to paint a more detailed picture of Australia’s biodiversity. More accurate metadata also helps to identify native vs. invasive species more readily for better biosecurity monitoring. </p>

<p>Now in its seventh year, the Threatened Species Bake Off hosted by the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/biodiversity/threatened/commissioner/tsbakeoff">Office of the Threatened Species Commissioner </a>(part of the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/biodiversity/threatened/commissioner"></a><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/">Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water</a>) is an excellent opportunity to raise the profile of Australia’s threatened species! </p>



<p>With hundreds of entries each year, there’s no shortage of love and passion for the event, but how can we make sure less-well-known species are also represented in the bake off?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, in Australia, there are more than 1,700 threatened species listed, with this number growing every year. The Atlas of Living Australia has put together a list of underrepresented species to help give you inspiration to share the love across the species represented in the bake off entries this year! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/07/Fungi-Friday-1-1024x577.png" alt="" class="wp-image-48656" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/07/Fungi-Friday-1-1024x577.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/07/Fungi-Friday-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/07/Fungi-Friday-1-768x433.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/07/Fungi-Friday-1-1536x865.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/07/Fungi-Friday-1.png 1640w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Entries from previous years include: &nbsp;‘Moss, lichens, fungi &amp; Gippsland Giant Earthworm’ (credit Holly) and ‘Margaret River Burrowing Crayfish&nbsp;<em>(Engaewa pseudoreducta)’</em>&nbsp;(credit Linette).</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How you can get involved:</strong></p>



<p><em>Note entries are open 24 August &#8211; 24 September with Threatened Species Day on 7 September. </em></p>



<ol type="1">
<li>Choose an Australian threatened species to bake! Check out our list of species that are underrepresented in data records <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aBzHvM-ycEAsUYOHvMoh0pM4eMBvsOauAbn--nLPTYU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>



<li>Get creative with your baking! It doesn’t have to be a sweet treat if you’re more of a savoury connoisseur- try to capture the likeness of your chosen species the best you can.</li>



<li>Take a picture and upload it to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #TSBakeOff2023 and tag the Threatened Species Commissioner. If you’re unable to access social media, you can still submit your entry by sending your picture to <a href="mailto:tsbakeoff@environment.gov.au">tsbakeoff@dcceew.gov.au</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Each year, a panel of judges will assess the entry to the bake off across the following categories: Early Learners Award, Children’s Award, Open Category, People’s Choice, Schools Award and Organisation Award.  </p>



<p>You can further help threatened species in Australia by engaging in citizen science to help fill the gaps in species records across the country. One of the most effective tools for protecting our native biodiversity is having access to information that shows where species are and how their populations are changing over time. Taxonomic groups like invertebrates, fungi and plants are underrepresented in species occurrence records, therefore the number of identified threatened species from these groups is thought to be much higher than current reported figures.

<p>Hosted by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), this webinar brings together expert speakers from three organisations to explore the challenges, management strategies, and data sensitivities used to protect Australia’s rarest and most vulnerable species. </p>



<p>Restricted Access Species Data &#8211; often known as ‘sensitive species data’ – is information about biodiversity with features that mean there are reasons for withholding the data from public view or modifying it before it is made public. An example of why obscuring species information may be necessary is because exposing a species’ exact location could risk harm, exploitation, or poaching. Restricted Access Species Data are needed for conservation management, decision-making, and research to implement strategies to best protect ‘sensitive species.’</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Launching the National Framework for the Sharing of Restricted Access Species Data and the Restricted Access Species Data Service for Australia]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.rasd.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Framework for the Sharing of Restricted Access Species Data</a> provides a best practice guide for the custodians and users of species data that is restricted.</p>



<p>The development of the National Framework streamlines the process of accessing, sharing and managing restricted access species data across Australia, leading to better environmental management and improved species outcomes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="578" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/06/RASD_Headline-Image-v21-1024x578.png" alt="Green caterpillar on a blue background with the ALA, ARDC and NCRIS logos" class="wp-image-48569" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/06/RASD_Headline-Image-v21-1024x578.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/06/RASD_Headline-Image-v21-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/06/RASD_Headline-Image-v21-768x434.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/06/RASD_Headline-Image-v21-1536x867.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/06/RASD_Headline-Image-v21.png 1640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Caption: Sensitive species Australian Atlas Moth (Attacus wardi), photo credit James P. Tuttle CC BY NC&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Historically, the difficulty of accessing restricted data on species has created barriers for research, environmental <a>assessmen</a>t and conservation. Data on species has been modified, withheld or shared based on inconsistent organisational polices. The <a>National Framework </a>is the first of its kind, jointly developed by the Atlas of Living Australia, the Australian Research Data Commons, all the government environmental agencies in Australia, herbaria, fauna collections, EcoCommons Australia and the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute.</p>



<p>Sharing the precise locations of restricted<a> access </a>species potentially risks disturbance, harm or exploitation. Therefore, access to some species information is limited, accessible only to data custodians and approved data users.</p>



<p>The National Framework outlines the principles to guide data custodians and users in the sharing of restricted access species data responsibly and appropriately. By adopting a nationally consistent evidence-based approach to managing restricted access species data, the National Framework aim to:</p>



<ul>
<li>promote responsible data-sharing practices</li>



<li>give data custodians the confidence to safely share restricted access species data</li>



<li>assist data custodians to maintain the consistency and quality of data.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>“BirdLife Australia has long upheld a restricted access policy for sensitive species data as a basis for our citizen science work. This gives contributors the confidence that sharing their data will not put species at risk, while still allowing for its use in conservation. We are excited to now have a nationally consistent framework for sensitive species data sharing, which will massively increase the use and impact of bird and other species data in science and conservation” said</em> Dr Golo Maurer, BirdLife Citizen Science Program Leader.</p>



<p><strong>A Restricted Access Species Data Service (RASDS) for Australia</strong></p>



<p>The new RASDS allows researchers and other trusted data users to request restricted access species data from all participating data custodians in Australia via a central point. &nbsp;The service allows data custodians a way of managing and storing request workflows.</p>



<p><em>“RASDS seeks to remove a major barrier to the flow of species data by standardising the way we describe and exchange sensitive species data</em>” said Ron Avery, STL Biodiversity Information Systems Science, Economics and Insight Division, NSW Dept&nbsp;of Planning and Environment.</p>



<p><strong>Partners:</strong></p>



<p>These products were developed as part of a collaborative project between the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/#tab_pane-C">Atlas of Living Australia</a>, <a href="https://ardc.edu.au">Australian Research Data Commons</a> (ARDC), the Australian Government, state and territory governments, conservation agencies, museums, and herbaria, <a href="https://www.ecocommons.org.au/">EcoCommons</a> and the <a href="https://wabsi.org.au/">Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome to the June 2023 edition of our ALA newsletter.</p>



<p>Biological collections play an important role in understanding trends in biodiversity life sciences. With advances in genomics, imaging, artificial intelligence and machine learning, more information can be obtained from physical-biological specimens than has ever been possible before. </p>



<p>The ALA has been proud to play a key role in ensuring data emerging from Australia’s collections is made findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable globally. Recently, the ALA was pleased to partner with our key stakeholders across the museums, collections and herbaria sectors to host a national workshop in Canberra. The workshop &#8211; <em>‘Towards a national approach to biological collections’ </em>– brought together experts to explore current capabilities, emerging research drivers and key components that are required to support biological collections in Australia. Having our partners from across the nation meet together <a>highlighted the maturity and cohesiveness of our sector</a>, as well as the opportunities for international collaboration and improving data connections to deliver greater scientific benefit. We look forward to continuing collaborations to further advance work in this space at a national level. T<a>his will be pivotal in informing future priorities and co-investment pathways aligning with the recently released National Research Infrastructure Roadmap. </a></p>



<p><a>In addition </a>to a focus on collections for the rest of the year, we look forward to further engaging with the broader scientific community through multiple <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/where-to-find-the-atlas-of-living-australia-this-year/">conferences</a> such as the Ecological Society of Australia event in Darwin and the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) event in Hobart in the coming months. You’ll also find an exciting line-up of virtual events to support <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/national-science-week-2023/">National Science Week </a>in August which I encourage you to register for participation.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy our June newsletter.</p>
