										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2023, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the <a>Australian Seed Bank Partnership </a>(ASBP) collaborated to launch a new version of the Australian Seed Bank Online, the <a href="https://seedbank.ala.org.au/">Australian Virtual Seed Bank</a>&nbsp;(AVSB). &nbsp;The AVSB shares sustainable seed collecting and banking practices and provides open-access information about both seed collections and the germination protocols used across seed banks in Australia. Primarily used by seed curators, collectors, research community members, students, industry and government, the AVSB is an essential resource for preserving critical plant information on Australian plant biodiversity and is hosted by the ALA.</p>



<p>The ALA team has worked in <a>close collaboration</a> with the ASBP to develop this capability, bringing together subject matter experts and software developers to produce a world-class innovative digital platform. The AVSB is a refreshed digital open-access resource that has been designed to increase the accessibility and usability of information about Australian plants. It links seed bank data with images, taxonomic and occurrence data in the ALA and collection, trait and genomic data from other sources to be accessible via a single online platform. The AVSB is the first ALA application to implement a <a href="https://ala.org.au/current-projects/extended-data-model-project/">new </a><a>type of ALA database</a> which allows for complex relationships between different types of data and seed bank activities to be accurately represented and navigated. The AVSB was developed over two years, as part of an iterative process, continually testing and seeking feedback from the broader seed bank community.<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

<p><em>â€˜The Australian Seed Bank Partnership is an alliance of 14 organisations, bringing together expertise from Australiaâ€™s leading botanic gardens, state environment agencies and NGOs. Developing and sharing knowledge is a high priority for us and working with the ALA on the new ASBO portal allows partners to share significantly more data than we have in the past. We canâ€™t wait to share the portal with the conservation communityâ€™&nbsp;</em>said Dr Ameila Martyn Yenson A/g National Coordinator Australian Seed Bank Partnership.</p>



<p>The AVSB&#8217;s user-friendly format offers a unique opportunity to deep-dive into the world of ex-situ collections across Australia and shares hundreds of years of collective experience from seed experts across the topics of seed collection, storage, research, ecology, germination, and more.

<p>Does it croak or growl, have fangs or howl? Does it scream at night or give you a fright? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f383.png" alt="ðŸŽƒ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Many iconic living (or dead) things that are seen around Halloween are inspired by species in the natural world! Check out some of the most spook-tacular Aussie species!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1009" height="541" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-47481" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC.jpg 1009w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Goblin Shark (<em>Mitsukurina owstoni</em>) Museums Victoria CC BY NC</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/b1b5f1e3-1efa-4d18-b8f7-d26731b964cc#overview">Goblin Shark (<em>Mitsukurina owstoni</em></a>)</strong></p>



<p>Talk about a creature from nightmares, the Goblin Shark is one of the most illusive deep-sea sharks known to scientists with a distinctive blade-like snout and pink skin. Specimens have been found along continental slopes at distances up to 1.3 km deep, measuring 3-4 metres in length. The Goblin Shark has distinctive mouthparts, specialised for rapid projection as their jaws can extend and retract to catch prey.</p>



<p>They are the only extant member of the&nbsp;<em>Mitsukurina</em>&nbsp;genus, often called a â€˜living fossilâ€™ as this genus traces back 125 million years. These sharks are incredibly illusive, with limited specimens recorded around NSW, Victoria and Tasmania in Australia, as well as Portugal and Japan. Not much is known about the reproductive life cycle of this species as a pregnant Goblin Shark has never been recorded.</p>

<p>If the pumpkin-orange colour doesnâ€™t scare you off, maybe its stench will! This stinkbug produces a rotten-smelling spray from the chemical â€˜cimicine.â€™ This spray doesnâ€™t just pack a pungent punch, its main function is to be a defensive mechanism against predators â€“ most commonly other arthropods and birds â€“ which can be lethal to these species. To humans, the spray can cause significant irritation. This is a classic case of â€˜look but donâ€™t touchâ€™, no matter your species!</p>



<p>As eggs and nymphs, Bronze Orange Bugs are green in colour but as they mature through their five instar stages of development, they acquire their distinctive orange colour to resemble citrus leaves. They are considered pests in commercial citrus orchards across eastern Australia.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not just itâ€™s physical appearance thatâ€™s scary, this plantâ€™s impact on biosecurity is equally terrifying.</p>



<p>Also known as the â€˜cemetery flowerâ€™ or â€˜common thorn appleâ€™, this plant is one of the most invasive noxious weeds around the world, including in Australia. It has been known to poison humans and animals, reduce pasture productivity and compete with native flora.</p>



<p>A member of the nightshade family, Jimsonweed was originally introduced in Australia in the 1800s for medicinal and ornamental purposes. The most toxic part of the plant are its black seeds which disperse through water, contaminated hay and mud stuck to vehicles.&nbsp;The spiny seed capsule is as aggressive as it looks and will injure those who dare to touchâ€¦</p>

<p>Australia is home to more than 90 species of bats including both mega bats and micro bats. Although some bat species around the world do feed on blood (and are most likely the inspiration for Halloween stories), the Spectacled Flying Fox is more likely bring you joy rather than terror!</p>



<p>These endangered fruit bats live in the northern tropics and feed on native fruits, flowers, and myrtle plants. They play a pivotal role in rainforest ecosystems as seed dispersers and pollinators. Aptly named, the Spectacled Flying Fox has light yellow fur around its eyes and snout giving the appearance that its wearing glasses. They typically live to be around 12 -15 years old in the wild but have been known to live up to 30 years old in captivity.</p>

<p>A shriek in the night, a blood curdling scream, you investigate the source only to findâ€¦a Far Eastern Curlew?</p>



<p>Known for making exceptionally long migratory travels to breed between northern and southern hemispheres, Far Eastern Curlews are also iconic for their scream-like vocalisation calls.&nbsp;They use their hauntingly beautiful calls as part of mating displays and to assert dominance over their territory.</p>



<p>With a long scimitar-shaped beak which can be more than 50% the length of their body and dark-streaked plumage, the Far Eastern Curlew is the largest shorebird in the world. This species is reliant on mudflats and mangrove swamps for feeding and breeding. Unfortunately, this species is listed as â€˜endangeredâ€™ due to loss of habitat, causing population decline across their ranges.</p>

<p>Hairy, spotty and slime green! Could this spider be the ultimate creature for Halloween?</p>



<p>Orbweaver spiders are common across Australia, known for making intricate, sticky webs at night to catch prey. Orbweavers occupy crevices and leaves during the day, and if they feel significantly threatened, they will drop to the ground and â€˜play dead.â€™</p>



<p>The Speckled Orbweaver prefers to occupy green foliage, to blend in with the surroundings. As with many spider species, females are larger than males at approximately 6mm in length, with males 3mm in length.</p>

<p>Like something out of a fairy-tale, Ghost Fungi glow through their gills with a green-tinged light. They emit â€˜cold lightâ€™ where less than 20% of light emitted is capable of radiating heat. Ghost Fungi, and other bioluminescent creatures, fluoresce using a compound called â€˜luciferinâ€™. They grow on dead or decaying wood and are commonly found across Australia in temperate areas. The exact reason this species uses bioluminescence is not known, however a theory is that by glowing the fungi attracts insects which disperse its spores.</p>



<p>Ghost Fungi are poisonous if consumed, however are often mistaken for Oyster Mushrooms due to their similar fan-like appearance and milky-white colouration in the daytime.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the October 2023 edition of our ALA newsletter.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Itâ€™s been an exciting month for the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), CSIRO and our national partners as we welcomed the worldâ€™s biodiversity data community to Hobart and Canberra for a series of conferences, meetings and symposia. Our journey began by hosting this yearâ€™s annual meeting of the biodiversity data standards group <a href="https://tdwg2023.zohobackstage.com.au/TDWG2023">TDWG</a> in Hobart from October 9<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup>. The event welcomed 166 participants from 26 countries (with 143 joining virtually) to present, learn and connect. We are grateful to those who continue the work of TDWG and biodiversity data standards. The TDWG-maintained Darwin Core standard has underpinned so many of the world&#8217;s biodiversity data systems, including the ALA, and ensures interoperable biodiversity data can move freely across platforms and borders. Events such as the TDWG annual meeting are fundamental in supporting the evolution of the standard and learning about the biodiversity science and applications it enables. <br><br>TDWG was a timely precursor to our next series of events hosted in Canberra and framed around the two-day Governing Board meeting of the <a href="https://gb30.gbif.org/">Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).</a> Australia last hosted the fourth Governing Board meeting (GB04) in 2002 at the National Academy of Sciences and then welcomed 18 countries to Canberra. 21 years later, we hosted 45 people from 30 countries at the National Portrait Gallery and CSIRO (with a further 28 participants joining online from 12 countries) to govern, support and grow the GBIF network. We were pleased to be joined by the Honourable Minister for the Environment and Water Tanya Plibersek at the gala dinner hosted at the National Museum of Australia. <a href="https://minister.dcceew.gov.au/plibersek/speeches/speech-global-diversity-information-facility-gala-dinner" data-type="link" data-id="https://minister.dcceew.gov.au/plibersek/speeches/speech-global-diversity-information-facility-gala-dinner">The Minister&#8217;s address</a> affirmed the importance of data in supporting national and international biodiversity policy priorities and the ALA looks forward to working with our international and national partners to support these. <br><br>Hosting this series of international meetings highlights the leadership role that Australia plays, and the ALA is grateful to the individuals and teams that have put such a strong foundation in place over more than a decade. These partnerships also highlight the importance of international collaboration in improving the national biodiversity data landscape, and ultimately our ability to understand, conserve and enhance the worldâ€™s biodiversity. Iâ€™m grateful to our team and our fellow CSIRO colleagues who played such an important role in hosting and welcoming our international guests to Australia.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>As Australiaâ€™s national biodiversity data infrastructure, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is committed to providing reliable and secure data access to our users. In line with this commitment, we are excited to announce our transition to OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, which will help to streamline the process for accessing data within the ALA across multiple platforms.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-oidc">What is OIDC?</h2>



<p>With OIDC, you can log in to multiple platforms using a single set of sign-in credentials while ensuring that your personal information is secure and private.</p>



<p>OIDC is an identity layer built on top of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://oauth.net/2/" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a> protocol. It&#8217;s designed to facilitate secure authentication and single sign-on (SSO) across different applications and services. If youâ€™d like to read more about how OIDC works with OAuth 2.0, see OpenID Foundation&#8217;s article on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/" target="_blank">how OpenID Connect works</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/" target="_blank">.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-1024x858.png" alt="the layers of how OIDC works. when a HTTP request is sent, OAuth2.0 checks for authorisation access permissions, and OIDC checks for user identity" class="wp-image-48868" style="object-fit:contain;width:633px;height:531px" width="633" height="531" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-1024x858.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-300x251.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-768x644.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1-1536x1288.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/OIDC-1.png 1880w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="why-oidc">Why OIDC?</h2>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="enhanced-security"><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3>



<p>One of the key drivers behind ALA&#8217;s adoption of OpenID Connect (OIDC) is its ability to enhance data security.</p>



<p>OIDC operates by employing secure tokens in the background to validate a user&#8217;s identity. These tokens are designed to be short-lived and encrypted, ensuring that your credentials remain protected and reducing the potential for unauthorised access or data breaches.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="seamless-user-experience"><strong>Seamless User Experience</strong></h3>



<p>Weâ€™re committed to improving your experience across the ALA site; while this includes features like navigation, readability and look and feel, it also relates to login experience and performance. OIDC enhances our current SSO capabilities, allowing you to log in once to access multiple services without repeatedly entering your credentials.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="federated-sign-in"><strong>Federated sign-in</strong></h3>



<p>OIDC also enhances federated identity services. This means that you can continue to leverage your existing accounts from trusted identity providers such as the <a href="https://aaf.edu.au/">Australian Access Federation</a> (AAF), eliminating the need to create another username and password â€“ making it quicker and easier to access the ALA for existing AAF users.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="scalability-and-integration"><strong>Scalability and Integration</strong></h3>



<p>As the number of records in the ALA grows, we ensure that our systems are flexible and scalable. OIDC allows us to integrate with a variety of web applications and evolve alongside other technical advancements.</p>



<p>Collaboration is also a big part of what we do at the ALA, so we can continue to make even more data findable and accessible. With the growing adoption of OIDC, integration is made easier with our data partners and other collaborators. For example, we are working with <a href="https://www.tern.org.au/">TERN</a> to integrate OIDC, making it quicker and easier for our <a href="https://fieldcapture.ala.org.au/">MERIT</a> users to sign in and submit data to the MERIT system using the TERN Monitor application.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="summary">Summary</h2>



<p>The adoption of OIDC authentication represents a significant milestone in the ALAâ€™s ongoing commitment to data security, performance, and user experience. We remain dedicated to staying at the forefront of technology to do so, and we look forward to continued growth and collaboration with our user community. The ALA has more exciting infrastructure and technology changes coming soon â€“ watch this space!</p>



<p>If you would like to know more about how OIDC benefits your data access experience, please reach out at <a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Celebrating #WorldCassowaryDay]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Err&#8230; is that a bird or a dinosaur?</p>



<p>Well, both (kind of)! Weâ€™re talking about the <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https:/biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/5fc1b9fe-ccdd-4c3a-adfc-6f6e5c5c396b">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius</em></a>), often described as one of the closest living relatives of dinosaurs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-Tom-Hunt-CC-BY-NC-819x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48810" style="width:1000px;height:1024px" width="1000" height="1024"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius</em>) adult. Photo Credit Tom Hunt CC BY NC</figcaption></figure>



<p>These gigantic flightless birds (â€˜ratitesâ€™) occupy tropical areas of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. Cassowaries are the second heaviest birds in the world (after ostriches), with females reaching a maximum weight of 55kgs and males up to 76kgs! They lay bright green eggs, with dads stepping up to be in charge of incubation and chick rearing. Once the eggs hatch, baby cassowaries can walk almost immediately with their strong back legs. Babies are not born with their signature black plumage, instead have banded yellow and brown striped patterning as chicks. </p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="967" height="649" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48811" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC.jpg 967w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/09/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC-768x515.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius</em>) chick. Photo Credit DHFischer CC BY NC</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Keep your distance</strong></p>



<p>You&#8217;ll often hear these big birds before you see them! Cassowaries are notorious for communicating through deep rumbles, hisses and grunting sounds. Cassowaries use various vocalisations to communicate through their dense rainforest habitats. If you hear a cassowary calling, make sure you keep your distance. Equipped with a razor-sharp beak, talons and a particularly territorial nature, cassowaries are more than capable of tearing through flesh if they feel threatened. </p>



<p><strong>Keystone species</strong></p>



<p>Cassowaries are â€˜keystone speciesâ€™ &#8211; species which has a disproportionately important role in their natural ecosystems. In rainforest habitats across northern QLD, cassowaries play a critical role in dispersing many native seeds through fragmented rainforest landscapes. Due to their large size, cassowaries can swallow fruits and other plants whole, digest the pulp and excrete seeds intact in dung piles (aka natural fertilisers). This ability to disperse large seeds helps to maintain healthy ecosystems by promoting vegetation regeneration.</p>



<p>To better illustrate how cassowaries support native plant dispersal across rainforest ecosystems, Callum and Shandiya from the ALA Science and Decision Support team have created an interactive map. The map shows 15 native plant species across the QLD wet tropics against cassowary records in the ALA!</p>

<p>Are you interested in getting the most out of data in the ALA? Weâ€™ve developed the ALA {galah} tool to&nbsp;enable users to deep-dive and transform species occurrence information. Whether you want to locate and download species records, investigate taxonomic information and associated media such as images or sounds, or restrict queries to certain taxa or locations, {galah} can do it all! This tool has been developed for both the R-Studio and Python coding languages.</p>



<p>Our beginner-friendly workshop introduces a step-by-step introduction to using both {galah} for R-Studio and Python</p>

<p>Open science is the practice of making scientific knowledge, research and information accessible. As Australiaâ€™s national biodiversity data aggregator, we explore why open science is so important to delivering strong biodiversity outcomes.</p>



<p>Hear ALA team members Ely Wallis, Peggy Newman and Dax Kellie discuss:</p>



<ul>
<li>How the F.A.I.R. (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles are used through copyright and licencing in the ALA</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>How the ALA supports open science through its data infrastructure and services</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>How open science facilitates transparent, robust research.</li>
</ul>

<p>Citizen science is an accessible gateway for anybody to engage in science regardless of age, location or demographic. Integrated citizen science apps take in millions of species occurrence records each year, which are then verified before being fed through to the ALA to become open and accessible data.</p>



<p>Hear from Dr Erin Roger and Cam Slatyer from the ALA, Thomas Mesaglio from iNaturalist and Dr Jasmin Packer from the FungiMap Project discuss what makes a great species observation record, and learn tips and tricks for collecting the best qualityÂ metadata â€“ data about data. Higher quality metadata (attributes like location, images, date of collection, etc.) helps to paint a more detailed picture of Australiaâ€™s biodiversity. More accurate metadata also helps to identify native vs. invasive species more readily for better biosecurity monitoring.Â </p>

<p>Now in its seventh year, the Threatened Species Bake Off hosted by the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/biodiversity/threatened/commissioner/tsbakeoff">Office of the Threatened Species Commissioner </a>(part of the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/biodiversity/threatened/commissioner"></a><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/">Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water</a>) is an excellent opportunity to raise the profile of Australiaâ€™s threatened species!Â </p>



<p>With hundreds of entries each year, thereâ€™s no shortage of love and passion for the event, but how can we make sure less-well-known species are also represented in the bake off?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, in Australia, there are more than 1,700 threatened species listed, with this number growing every year. The Atlas of Living Australia has put together a list of underrepresented species to help give you inspiration to share the love across the species represented in the bake off entries this year! </p>

<p><strong>How you can get involved:</strong></p>



<p><em>Note entries are open 24 August &#8211; 24 September with Threatened Species Day on 7 September. </em></p>



<ol type="1">
<li>Choose an Australian threatened species to bake! Check out our list of species that are underrepresented in data records <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aBzHvM-ycEAsUYOHvMoh0pM4eMBvsOauAbn--nLPTYU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>



<li>Get creative with your baking! It doesnâ€™t have to be a sweet treat if youâ€™re more of a savoury connoisseur- try to capture the likeness of your chosen species the best you can.</li>



<li>Take a picture and upload it to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #TSBakeOff2023Â and tag the Threatened Species Commissioner. If youâ€™re unable to access social media, you can still submit your entry by sending your picture to <a href="mailto:tsbakeoff@environment.gov.au">tsbakeoff@dcceew.gov.au</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Each year, a panel of judges will assess the entry to the bake off across the following categories: Early Learners Award, Childrenâ€™s Award, Open Category, Peopleâ€™s Choice, Schools Award and Organisation Award. Â </p>



<p>You can further help threatened species in Australia by engaging in citizen science to help fill the gaps in species records across the country. One of the most effective tools for protecting our native biodiversity is having access to information that shows where species are and how their populations are changing over time. Taxonomic groups like invertebrates, fungi and plants are underrepresented in species occurrence records, therefore the number of identified threatened species from these groups is thought to be much higher than current reported figures.

<p>Hosted by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), this webinar brings together expert speakers from three organisations to explore the challenges, management strategies, and data sensitivities used to protect Australiaâ€™s rarest and most vulnerable species. </p>



<p>Restricted Access Species Data &#8211; often known as â€˜sensitive species dataâ€™ â€“ is information about biodiversity with features that mean there are reasons for withholding the data from public view or modifying it before it is made public. An example of why obscuring species information may be necessary is because exposing a speciesâ€™ exact location could risk harm, exploitation, or poaching. Restricted Access Species Data are needed for conservation management, decision-making, and research to implement strategies to best protect â€˜sensitive species.â€™</p>
