<p>After launching internationally in 2008, iNaturalist has blossomed into one of the most popular citizen science platforms in the world with more than 214 million observations across approximately 491,000 species, contributed by almost 3.4 million users (<a>as of October 2024). </a></p>



<p>While these are incredible collective results, it’s safe to say our local iNaturalist Australia node is a heavyweight on the global stage and, as a major contributor to Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) records, we’re celebrating a big milestone this month with iNaturalist Australia’s fifth birthday!</p>



<p><strong>iNaturalist Australia beginnings</strong></p>



<p>Although Australian observations on iNaturalist date <a>all the way back to </a><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/245">2008</a>, things were slow going for the first eight years. Records started to accumulate faster in late-2016 after the creation of the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/australasian-fishes"><em>Australasian Fishes</em> project</a>, but it wasn’t until late-2019 that things really took off. This kickstart to the exponential rise of observations for Australia was no coincidence: it marked the official launch of iNaturalist Australia as a node of the iNaturalist Network, with the local node run by the ALA.</p>



<p>To celebrate this five-year anniversary, we’ve summarised just some of what the iNaturalist community in Australia has achieved.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="724" src="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/10/iNat-usage-1024x724.jpg" alt="A line graph showing the number of Australian observations in iNaturalist since 2008. It shows there were very few observations until 2017, but this year reached 9 million observations.

Since June, this figure has now surpassed 9 million records!</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>



<p><strong>Some quick statistics</strong></p>



<p>Australia is one of the most significant contributors to iNaturalist globally, punching well above our weight relative to our population. We rank third in the world for the number of observations, second for the number of species (behind only the United States), and first in the southern hemisphere across all key metrics. As of <a>October 2024</a>, there are <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6744,7333,7616,10287,10293,118147">more than 9 million Australian observations on the platform</a> across approximately 60,000 species, contributed by 100,000 users. Importantly, more than 34,000 users have contributed identifications to Australian iNaturalist observations.</p>



<p>The most observed Australian species is the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6744,7333,7616,10287,10293,118147&amp;taxon_id=8575">Australian Magpie, with almost 35,000 observations</a>, followed by the Laughing Kookaburra, Koala, Superb Fairywren and Rainbow Lorikeet. The most observed major group, however, is <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6744,7333,7616,10287,10293,118147&amp;iconic_taxa=Plantae">plants with 2.85 million observations</a>, followed closely by <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=6744,7333,7616,10287,10293,118147&amp;iconic_taxa=Insecta">insects with 2.51 million observations</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why was the ALA-iNaturalist Australia partnership so important?</strong></p>



<p>By hosting iNaturalist Australia, the ALA sparked greater recruitment of two key demographics. First, more observers joined the platform, accelerating the accumulation of records. It took six years for Australia to reach 10,000 total iNaturalist records from 2008─2014 but now more than 10,000 new Australian records are uploaded to the platform <strong>every single day</strong>, and the number of observations uploaded to the site continues to grow exponentially. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Second, the ALA’s support of iNaturalist prompted many more experts to join the platform and contribute their expertise and knowledge, which has been <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001843">crucial for improving data quality</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How is your data being used?</strong></p>



<p>iNaturalist data are used extensively in conservation planning, land management, and thousands of scientific journal papers around the globe. In Australia, iNaturalist records feed directly into the ALA, allowing researchers all around the country to access the data at any time. Australian iNaturalist records are being used for a wide range of exciting and important research, including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720358770?casa_token=-R-YI0mMMCoAAAAA:RzC-t2Qr07fBLAh6s6_kV_hRlFRNhk8ynNfBOSIASjEckHcfTTywlp5XLkmA39qzxurqTg">understanding the effects of bushfires on biodiversity</a>, <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR24046">monitoring species of biosecurity concern</a>, <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v688/p167-172/">quantifying habitat composition from images</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381433/">rediscovering long unobserved species</a>, and <a href="https://mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.5380.3.1">even discovering, and facilitating the description of, undescribed genera and species</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How can I get involved?</strong></p>



<p>You can use iNaturalist through <a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/">a browser on your computer</a><a href="#_msocom_6"> </a>or via the mobile phone app: check out <a href="https://ala.org.au/publications/a-guide-to-inaturalist/">our in-depth guide</a> to get you started. iNaturalist Australia is the fastest growing citizen science platform in the country, so there’s no better time to join than now! The achievements to date have all been thanks to the dedicated and passionate people observing, identifying and curating observations of Australia’s amazing biodiversity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Who knew that ‘cake’ could help save the 'planet'? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p>Every year, wildlife lovers, conservationists, and ‘baking enthusiasts’ alike come together for an event like no other: the &#8216;Threatened Species Bake Off&#8217;. This quirky and creative competition, hosted as part of Australia’s Threatened Species Day (7th September), highlights endangered native animals and plants through the medium of delicious baked goods.</p>



<p>The concept is simple: bake a treat inspired by one of Australia&#8217;s many threatened species, whether it’s the critically endangered Eastern Curlew, the iconic Koala, or even a lesser-known species like the Wollemi Pine. The idea is to raise awareness of the biodiversity crisis while having a bit of fun in the kitchen.</p>



<p>But why bake? While conservation efforts traditionally focus on research, policy, and habitat restoration, the bake-off taps into something more universal: food and creativity. By encouraging people to express their love for endangered species through cake, biscuits, and cupcakes, this event engages a broader audience that might not otherwise be involved in conservation conversations. Plus, who can resist a beautifully decorated cake shaped like a bilby?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="a-recipe-for-change">A Recipe for Change</h2>



<p>The Bake Off shines a light on species at risk of extinction, but it also allows us to celebrate their beauty and importance. Participants research their chosen species, learning about their habitats, threats, and the conservation efforts in place to protect them. This process creates a deep connection between the baker and their species, sparking conversations with family and friends about biodiversity loss.</p>



<p>And while the cakes are the stars of the show, the underlying message is vital: Australia is facing an extinction crisis. Over 1,800 species of animals and plants are listed as threatened under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Habitat destruction, climate change, and invasive species are driving many of these species towards extinction. The Threatened Species Bake Off is a sweet reminder that we need to take action.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>



<p>The rules are simple: choose a threatened species, bake something inspired by it, and share your creation on social media with the hashtag #ThreatenedSpeciesBakeOff. It’s a great way to get involved whether you’re a novice baker or a seasoned pro.</p>



<p>Judges are often well-known figures from the conservation world, who will assess entries on creativity, accuracy in depicting the species, and, of course, how delicious the bake looks! While the competition is friendly, the impact is serious: each entry raises awareness of the need for urgent action to protect Australia’s biodiversity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" id="get-involved">Get Involved</h2>



<p>Even if you’re not the best baker, the Threatened Species Bake Off is a fun way to learn about Australia’s unique wildlife and help spread the word about the threats they face. By participating or sharing posts about the bake-off, you’re contributing to a larger conversation about biodiversity and conservation.</p>



<p>So, dust off your apron, grab your mixing bowl, and get creative for a cause. Because sometimes, the best way to start saving the planet is with a slice of cake.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ALA's new book – Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Why did we publish this book?</strong>?</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p>Tidying messy data can be difficult, but it is a task that anybody who works with data must face if they want to use data to tackle scientific questions!</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia&#8217;s (ALA) Science &amp; Decision Team recently authored a book titled&nbsp;<a href="https://cleaning-data-r.ala.org.au/">Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</a>. This free resource provides up-to-date information on data cleaning processes for anybody who handles their data using code in R. As Australia’s national biodiversity database, the ALA is frequently asked questions about the best way to clean data using code.&nbsp; To provide advice on this topic, our first step was to investigate what the currently accepted “best” way might be. We deep-dived into multiple recent peer-reviewed research to see whether experts cleaned their biodiversity data in the same way.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://edit.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/08/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-712x1024.png" alt="cover of the data cleaning book, with dark blue background and an orange crustacean" class="wp-image-49700" style="width:312px;height:auto"/></figure></div></div>
</div>



<p>Through this process we discovered that the steps to clean ecological data can be really messy! Even among experts, data cleaning can look completely different depending on the type of investigation and study species. No wonder people ask how to do it!</p>



<p>This book is our response to questions about how to clean biodiversity data in R. The book provides guidance on many of the processes for cleaning biodiversity data.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://edit.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/08/simplified_workflow-1024x513.png" alt="flow diagram with multiple grey lines intersecting, to illustrate the high number of possible workflows" class="wp-image-49710"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>A flow diagram of possible ecological data cleaning workflows (made using data from ALA’s review). Credit: Martin Westgate</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>What’s covered in the book and who is it for?</strong></p>



<p>In <em>Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</em>, we provide an overview of a typical biodiversity data cleaning workflow for open-access geo-referenced biodiversity data—from acquisition, to error identification, to correction. These processes are broken down into sections on exploring data, general data cleaning, and data cleaning processes that require expertise in your study species. The book has information suited to those just starting out working with biodiversity using R, to those who are looking for more advanced techniques.</p>

<p>Tidying messy data can be difficult, but it is a task that anybody who works with data must face if they want to use data to tackle scientific questions!</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia&#8217;s (ALA) Science &amp; Decision Team recently authored a book titled&nbsp;<a href="https://cleaning-data-r.ala.org.au/">Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</a>. This free resource provides up-to-date information on data cleaning processes for anybody who handles their data using code in R. As Australia’s national biodiversity database, the ALA is frequently asked questions about the best way to clean data using code.&nbsp; To provide advice on this topic, our first step was to investigate what the currently accepted “best” way might be. We deep-dived into multiple recent peer-reviewed research to see whether experts cleaned their biodiversity data in the same way.</p>

</div>



<p>Through this process we discovered that the steps to clean ecological data can be really messy! Even among experts, data cleaning can look completely different depending on the type of investigation and study species. No wonder people ask how to do it!</p>



<p>This book is our response to questions about how to clean biodiversity data in R. The book provides guidance on many of the processes for cleaning biodiversity data.</p>

<p><strong>What’s covered in the book and who is it for?</strong></p>



<p>In <em>Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</em>, we provide an overview of a typical biodiversity data cleaning workflow for open-access geo-referenced biodiversity data—from acquisition, to error identification, to correction. These processes are broken down into sections on exploring data, general data cleaning, and data cleaning processes that require expertise in your study species. The book has information suited to those just starting out working with biodiversity using R, to those who are looking for more advanced techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Meet the ALA&#8217;s Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program winners</strong></p>



<p>Australia (?!) — is home to unique biodiversity and ecosystems. So – it&#8217;s vital-that researchers, governments and industry have access to high-quality data so they can better understand, monitor and protect species!</p>



<p>How?</p>



<p>While biodiversity data such as physical specimens in collections, or data from field programs are used to address specific research goals, these data often require additional resources to ensure they can be digitised and made available nationally as open data.</p>
