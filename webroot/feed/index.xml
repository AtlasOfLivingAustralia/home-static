<p>In October 2021, we introduced a feature to the ALA that requests information from registered users about the type of organisation they’re affiliated with e.g. university, government, education etc.</p>



<p>Now when new users first create their account with the ALA, they will be asked to pick the type of organisation they are affiliated with from a set list.</p>



<p>The list includes 18 options including University researcher, Museum/herbarium/library, Government, Industry, Volunteer, and more.</p>



<p>Options of&nbsp;<em>Other</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Prefer not to say</em>&nbsp;are given if users either can’t find a category they fit into or don’t wish to divulge the information.</p>



<p>Returning users will be asked, just once when they next log in, to pick their organisation affiliation.</p>



<p>All users can edit their profile to update their institutional affiliation (and the other data) anytime they’re logged in. For more information on how to do this, read our help article <a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000195200-how-do-i-manage-the-settings-for-my-account-">How do I manage the settings for my account?</a></p>



<h3 id="why-the-change"><strong>Why the change?</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>The ALA has been asked to gather this information by our principal funding body, <a href="https://www.dese.gov.au/ncris">National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).</a></p>



<p>We will be asked to aggregate and report on the data every 6 months. The report won’t be associated at all with individual user logins and no personal information will be provided in the report – just a total count for each user type.</p>



<h3 id="more-information"><strong>More information</strong><strong></strong></h3>

					<description><![CDATA[Renowned citizen science program CoralWatch launched their new database using the ALA's Biocollect field data collection platform.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="321" height="157" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/Coral-watch-logo.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-45630" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/Coral-watch-logo.jpg 321w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/Coral-watch-logo-300x147.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>CoralWatch is a not-for-profit organisation based at The University of Queensland. It is a globally significant citizen science program that started in 2002. It aims to involve anyone (divers, students, scientists and tourists) in monitoring coral colour to help us understand more about coral health and bleaching events.</p>



<p>CoralWatch creates simple and engaging tools to help citizen scientists monitor global coral health and raises awareness of our reefs via education and public outreach programs.</p>



<h3 id="collecting-valuable-data-about-coral-health"><strong>Collecting valuable data about coral health</strong> </h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/coral-health-chart-biocollect-and-ala-logos-002-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-45631" width="389" height="389" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/coral-health-chart-biocollect-and-ala-logos-002-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/coral-health-chart-biocollect-and-ala-logos-002-300x300.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/coral-health-chart-biocollect-and-ala-logos-002-150x150.png 150w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/coral-health-chart-biocollect-and-ala-logos-002-768x768.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/coral-health-chart-biocollect-and-ala-logos-002-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/coral-health-chart-biocollect-and-ala-logos-002.png 1656w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /><figcaption>The CoralWatch Health Chart is a tool to help citizen scientists collect data about the colour and coral type.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Through CoralWatch people help collect scientific data on coral bleaching by using the Coral Health Chart. The chart is an easy-to-use tool to quantify changes in coral colour associated with coral bleaching on our reefs.</p>



<p>The colours on the Coral Health Chart are based on the actual colours of bleached and healthy corals. Each colour square corresponds to the concentration of symbiotic algae living in the coral tissue, which is directly linked to coral health. For more information, visit <a href="https://coralwatch.org/index.php/monitoring/using-the-chart/">Using the coral health chart</a></p>



<p>The chart is used in the field and classroom, is available in 12 languages and data on more than 2,500 reefs in 81 countries is publicly accessible.</p>



<h3 id="updating-the-coralwatch-database"><strong>Updating the CoralWatch database</strong></h3>



<p>After almost 20 years of operation the CoralWatch team needed to update the global database and partnered with the <a href="https://www.qcif.edu.au/about-us/who-we-are/">Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF)</a> and the Atlas of Living Australia to find a solution.</p>



<p>The BioCollect platform is a customisable field data collection tool and proved a good base to build the new CoralWatch database. The QCIF team developed new code to display graphs for the CoralWatch database and the ALA provided technical support and is hosting the database. The new graphs feature is now available to other users of the platform too.</p>



<p>All historical data (almost 15,000 reef visits and more than 320,000 coral observations) was imported to BioCollect. The new database can support images and record verification. It will also be able to cope with the growing data storage needs of the CoralWatch project.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>The citizen science bushfire recovery projects enable people to connect with nature and science while collecting and processing crucial data for scientists and governments to use in bushfire research and recovery. This work is supported by the Australian Government’s $200 million Bushfire Recovery Program for Wildlife and their Habitat.</p>



<p>“We were pleased to partner with the Atlas of Living Australia for this important community focused work. The three projects will support fire-affected communities to re-engage with nature and the science of recovery. Citizen scientists will be able to collect evidence on the impacts of large-scale fire on biodiversity.”</p>

<p>The insect digitisation project focuses on a list of priority insect species. Members of the public participate by using the DigiVol platform to transcribe insect specimen labels in CSIRO’s National Insect Collection. DigiVol is run by the Australian Museum and is supported by Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) infrastructure. Volunteers have already digitised and transcribed 1000s of specimens. Many of the insect specimens being digitised have few or no occurrence records in the ALA and some specimens date back nearly 100 years. This information will help us understand historical changes in insect distribution across space and time.</p>

<p>This work builds on the lead role the ALA took after the 2019-20 bushfires to explore how the citizen science sector could be supported<br>and coordinated to help deliver research-ready data in the bushfire space. Products from this work included the Citizen Science Bushfire<br>Project Finder and tailored blogs highlighting projects to participate in pre and post disaster events.</p>

<p>Echidna CSI is a research project run by the University of Adelaide using data collected by citizen scientists to study echidnas. The project has had a huge impact on echidna research and conservation.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/21280-Case-Study-Fact-Sheets-–-Echidna-V2.pdf"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/echidna-csi-thumbnail.png" alt="" class="wp-image-45444" width="314" height="440" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/echidna-csi-thumbnail.png 644w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/echidna-csi-thumbnail-214x300.png 214w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/11/21280-Case-Study-Fact-Sheets-–-Echidna-V2.pdf">View or print this impact story as a pdf</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Using a bespoke mobile app, (which uses the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) BioCollect application as its database) and an army of citizen scientists across the country, Echidna CSI has established an Australia-wide distribution map of Short-Beaked Echidnas (Tachyglossus  culeatus). The project has doubled the number of echidna records in the ALA and discovered new facts about echidna biology. Echidna CSI encourages the public to take photos of echidnas around Australia and collect their scats for DNA and hormone analysis. Over the past<br>three years, thousands of participants have recorded more than 12,000 echidna sightings. This is the largest dataset collected by any project for echidnas. The data is providing valuable information on wild populations’ habitat, diet and health including insights into the impact of  ushfires on echidna microbiomes.</p>



<h3 id="study-the-shy-echidna-challenge-accepted">Study the shy Echidna? Challenge accepted</h3>



<p>Echidnas are notoriously shy and difficult to see in the wild, and prior to Echidna CSI they were considered pretty difficult (and expensive) to  tudy. As a result, although echidnas are iconic  native species and threatened by feral animals, habitat loss and road collisions, many aspects of wild populations including their distribution, biology and population trends were largely unknown. The Echidna CSI project brought<br>together ecologists, molecular researchers and computer scientists from the University of Adelaide, the Atlas of Living Australia’s biodiversity data infrastructure, and Australia’s citizen science community to fill the gaps in our knowledge about echidnas. </p>

<p>The research team developed their own custom mobile application for the collection of data and linked this to the  ALA’s BioCollect field data collection tool as the backend database and data access/visualisation tool, to enable citizen scientists to record echidna observations. All observations flow automatically into the ALA. The project has robust quality assurance processes built into it to ensure all records are verified, research-grade data points.  The research team also have access to all citizen scientist echidna observations in the ALA uploaded via other applications such as iNaturalist. The Echidna CSI app is customised to the project and designed to guide users into collecting information that will be of most use. It also includes fun facts about echidnas so users can learn more about this iconic Australian species.</p>



<h3 id="mobile-app-has-huge-impact-for-echidna-research-and-conservation">Mobile app has huge impact for echidna research and conservation</h3>



<p>By combining novel science with citizen science, the Echidna CSI citizen science project has highlighted the extraordinary power of the citizen<br>science approach. More than 11,000 people have contributed to the Echidna CSI project. These citizen scientists have eyes on the ground in<br>many locations and have contributed sightings and genetic material from all states and territories including throughout protected areas and remote places. The research team could never have surveyed such a large area without the help of the Echidna CSI community contributors.</p>



<p>ALA infrastructure has been crucial in advancing echidna research and making the data, and data visualisations, accessible and open. This has resulted in the ability to leverage translational research, such as examining the impact of fire on echidna populations and diet.</p>



<h3 id="assessing-echidna-populations-after-the-2019-20-bushfires">Assessing echidna populations after the 2019-20 bushfires</h3>



<p>All echidna records collected before the 2019-2020 bushfire season served as crucial baseline information to monitor and assess the health of echidna populations post fire. Echidna CSI has conducted some local scale research in fire impacted areas and is documenting a change in echidna microbiomes in areas such as Kangaroo Island in South Australia. This subspecies of echidnas is listed as endangered, so the more we can learn about their response to fire the better.</p>

<p>Australian animals show an enormous diversity of movement behaviour, due to a long evolutionary history of adaptation to highly variable – and occasionally extreme – environmental conditions. In this webinar, you will hear from three researchers investigating animal movement over different spatial and temporal scales, from individual habitat patches in our cities; to nomadic movements spanning millions of hectares; to shifts in species distributions across geological timescales. Join us to hear more about our amazing fauna and how science is shedding light on ways to conserve Australia’s biodiversity.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44152" width="179" height="179" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px" /></figure></div>



<p>The critical importance of identifying, describing, conserving and restoring biodiversity is receiving increasing recognition due to the cumulative impacts of species loss (Woinarski et al 2019), climate change (Hoffman et al 2015), summer bushfires (Godfrey et al, 2021, Saunders et al 2021) and increasing biosecurity threats in Australia (Dodd et al 2020). Understanding the role of biodiversity plays in human health (Bratman et al. 2019) and the provision of ecosystem services to support a more sustainable agricultural sector, continues to demand innovative research solutions.</p>



<p>In parallel, Australia’s environmental policy and management landscape invests significant resources into biodiversity conservation, restoration and planning, in addition to supporting a world-class national biosecurity system that aims to maintain the health of our natural, agricultural and economic systems. This includes Commonwealth Government programs such as Agriculture Stewardship Package to promote biodiversity stewardship, wildlife and habitat funding totalling $200 million in response to 2019-20 bushfires, and the Regional Land Partnership program that is investing $450 million in species recovery and protecting threatened ecological communities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/ALA_Year_in_Review_2020-21_web5MB.pdf"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/ALA-Year-in-Review-thumbnail.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44933" width="328" height="329" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/ALA-Year-in-Review-thumbnail.png 710w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/ALA-Year-in-Review-thumbnail-300x300.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/ALA-Year-in-Review-thumbnail-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /></a><figcaption>Our<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/ALA_Year_in_Review_2020-21_web5MB.pdf"> ALA Year in Review 2020-21</a> highlights our achievements over the past year and the fundamental contributions from our data partners.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Collectively these research, policy and management programs demand continued access to the world-class sovereign biodiversity data infrastructure provided by the Atlas of Living Australia and our partners. We are proud to be playing an important role in ensuring research and decision-making is informed by the best available biodiversity data.</p>



<p>With this context in mind, in this issue of our newsletter we reflect on ALA’s fundamental role with the release of <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/ALA_Year_in_Review_2020-21_web5MB.pdf">our first Year-in-Review 2020-21</a>.  The year-in-review showcases our last year and reflects on the fundamental contribution made by our partners in supporting the mission of the ALA. Importantly it recognises the criticality of the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) program in shaping and supporting world-class national research infrastructure.</p>



<p>Which leads me to our future and the National Research Infrastructure (NRI) Roadmap process that is currently being led by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, and the <a href="https://2021nriroadmap.dese.gov.au/about/expert-working-group/">NRI Expert Working Group</a> which will steer the development of the Roadmap. For our stakeholders with an interest in the future of NRIs such as the ALA we encourage you to visit <a href="https://2021nriroadmap.dese.gov.au/">https://2021nriroadmap.dese.gov.au/</a> to learn how you can get more involved.</p>



<p>I hope you enjoy the September 2021 issue of our newsletter and look forward to seeing you in our upcoming science webinars.</p>

<p><strong>galah </strong>makes it easier to find, download and analyse data on Australian biodiversity using R, an open-source coding software. Since its initial release in July, thousands of download requests have been made using <strong>galah</strong>.</p>



<p>The new version (1.3.1) brings two exciting features to <strong>galah </strong>for the first time.</p>



<h2 id="range-queries-now-possible"><strong>Range queries now possible</strong></h2>



<p>First, this version supports ‘range queries’; that is, the capacity to state that you want values that are above or below a particular value. This makes it simple to state that you want all records after a particular year, or above a particular elevation. Combined with the ability to specify Boolean queries (such as AND, OR, NOT), this version of <strong>galah </strong>is a major upgrade. See the ‘<a href="https://atlasoflivingaustralia.github.io/galah/reference/select_filters.html">select_filters</a>’ page for more information.</p>



<h2 id="search-taxonomic-data-stored-by-the-ala"><strong>Search taxonomic data stored by the ALA</strong></h2>



<p>Second, and more importantly, version 1.3.1 introduces the <strong>ala_taxonomy() </strong>function. This function provides a new way to search through the taxonomic hierarchy within the ALA.</p>



<p>Taxonomic information downloaded using <strong>ala_taxonomy()</strong> is now returned as a taxonomic tree. This capability enables users to search for which lower clades are contained within a specified taxon. For example, users can find all clades at the family rank that stem from the class “Mammalia”. They can also search down to a number of other less formal taxonomic sub-ranks.</p>



<p>Taxonomic trees preserve ranks within their data structure, offering new opportunities to create data visualisations that harness this information. For a more detailed look at using <strong>ala_taxonomy()</strong>, see the <a href="https://atlasoflivingaustralia.github.io/galah/articles/taxonomic_information.html">Taxonomic Information page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="need-help-or-more-information"><strong>Need help or more information?</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll keep working on ways to make <strong>galah </strong>better over the coming months, so if you have any questions, comments, or spot any bugs, <a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">email us</a> or <a href="https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah/issues">report an issue</a> on our github page.</p>



<p>You can find more information on how to use <strong>galah </strong>on the <a href="https://atlasoflivingaustralia.github.io/galah/index.html">galah R package website</a></p>
