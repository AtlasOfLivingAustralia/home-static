<p>I’d like to welcome you to the May 2021 edition of our newsletter in which&nbsp;we profile a number of exciting developments&nbsp;in&nbsp;the ALA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, it’s a&nbsp;pleasure&nbsp;to be releasing&nbsp;the&nbsp;ALA’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/ALA-Workplan-2021-22_Final.pdf" target="_blank">annual work&nbsp;plan&nbsp;for&nbsp;2021-22</a>.&nbsp;Mid-last year we were excited to&nbsp;release&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf" target="_blank">ALA Strategy 2020-25</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;work&nbsp;plan provides an&nbsp;annual&nbsp;view into ALA priorities as articulated primarily through projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work&nbsp;plan is an&nbsp;outcome&nbsp;of&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;stakeholder conversations, the insight of the ALA leadership team and&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;from the ALA Advisory Board. It details a range of projects including&nbsp;major activities such as:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>an extension&nbsp;to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-upgrade-on-its-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Infrastructure Upgrade&nbsp;Project</a>&nbsp;working&nbsp;with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;a strategic shift to support more complex biodiversity data&nbsp;</li><li>our&nbsp;three&nbsp;Australian Research Data Commons&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;projects&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/ecoassets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EcoAssets</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/improving-access-to-sensitive-species-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sensitive Species Data Pathways</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/ecocommons-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EcoCommons&nbsp;Australia</a>, and&nbsp;</li><li>more tactical activities such as an uplift&nbsp;of&nbsp;the ALA’s&nbsp;R software&nbsp;suite&nbsp;and enhancements to our Biodiversity Information Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The ALA has historically focussed on harmonising Australia’s biodiversity data pertaining to native plants and animals, and providing related data products and services to our key users across research, government, industry and community. However, we are increasingly seeing the value of our infrastructure in supporting biosecurity-related applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this issue we highlight our partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment’s Chief Environmental Biosecurity Office, which has been able to leverage a decade of ALA data partnerships and robust infrastructure to support the development of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-helps-to-stop-pests-in-their-tracks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novel biosecurity alert capability</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a pressing need for an improved national approach for dealing with biosecurity data.&nbsp;I was reminded of this earlier this week with the Government’s release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/threatened-species-strategy-2021-2031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Threatened Species Strategy</a>&nbsp;where again we see the importance of understanding the distribution of invasive species, and the importance of&nbsp; knowledge and tools in supporting our mitigation programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a world of citizen science apps, biosecurity-related research programs,&nbsp;and government programs capturing data pertaining to species of biosecurity concern. Harmonising these data&nbsp;into a national data infrastructure will become an increasingly strategically important part of ALA’s work program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also been a tremendous few months with respect to team growth. We’ve welcomed two new data analysts to the ALA, working under Dr Martin Westgate, and in coming weeks we’ll welcome an R-developer to work alongside our partner EcoCommons program. </p>



<p>Our uplift in data analytics capability will provide improved ALA data support to external stakeholders, projects and partners. The new team members will complement our existing data management team responsible for liaising with our data partners to bring data into the ALA. They will provide customised data services to our partners and support the next partnership opportunity that arises.  </p>



<p>I hope you enjoy the May&nbsp;2021&nbsp;edition of our&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) team has been busy working on our Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project to improve our systems and make them more robust and more efficient.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="288" height="279" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/AcroRd32_2020-02-05_14-56-31.png" alt="ALA Infrastructure Upgrade Project icon" class="wp-image-43653"/></figure></div>



<p>The&nbsp;upgraded code base&nbsp;will replace the&nbsp;ALA’s&nbsp;species&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;record&nbsp;ingestion&nbsp;systems&nbsp;and&nbsp;will be released soon&nbsp;(late&nbsp;June-July 2021).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the work is happening behind the scenes, so hopefully&nbsp;you&nbsp;won’t&nbsp;notice&nbsp;any significant changes to your everyday use of the ALA.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you&nbsp;do&nbsp;see&nbsp;anything out of the&nbsp;ordinary&nbsp;please let us know on&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support@ala.org.au</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is just&nbsp;the first&nbsp;stage of our&nbsp;three stage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/current-projects/core-infrastructure-upgrade-project/">Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The&nbsp;</strong><strong>Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project</strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong>our</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>focus</strong><strong>&nbsp;for 2020-22</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project is a major&nbsp;project&nbsp;on our ALA Work Plan&nbsp;2020-21 and&nbsp;will continue into the coming year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project&nbsp;team&nbsp;has rewritten&nbsp;various components of the ALA&nbsp;species&nbsp;occurrence record&nbsp;ingestion&nbsp;system&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&nbsp;now shares a common code base with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Global Biodiversity Information Facility&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;plus&nbsp;some adjustments&nbsp;for the ALA’s specific requirements. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The new infrastructure will be&nbsp;fit-for-purpose, more maintainable and able to adapt to our future needs as Australia’s national biodiversity&nbsp;data infrastructure.&nbsp;These&nbsp;improvements will enable the ALA to manage increases in data volume and different types&nbsp;of data. ​ &nbsp;</p>



<p>The upgrade will also mean&nbsp;we&#8217;re&nbsp;better positioned to handle data load automation.&nbsp;Our data partners will be empowered to control the currency and quality of their data. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why are we upgrading ALA’s core infrastructure?  </strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>After 10 years of active development, the ALA’s core data processing infrastructure is approaching ‘end of life’. The Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project will enable the ALA to adapt to changing data and user requirements heading into our next decade of operation. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Getting ready for more data and more complex data</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are already seeing large volumes of new generation occurrence records coming from automated observations such as camera trapping, bioacoustics, animal tracking, and genetics including eDNA.&nbsp;Our current infrastructure is at&nbsp;capacity&nbsp;accommodating our&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;record volume of just under 100m records.&nbsp;We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;handle much larger data volumes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GBIF&nbsp;already&nbsp;manages 1.7 billion occurrence records and sees exponential year-on-year growth.&nbsp;By collaborating with GBIF, we&nbsp;greatly&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from their experience with large data volumes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new infrastructure will also enable us to join GBIF in adopting newer data types and other TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards) extensions. It will open up opportunities to collaborate on new initiatives with GBIF’s development team and the international biodiversity data community. </p>



<p><strong>Partnering with&nbsp;</strong><strong>GBIF</strong><strong>&nbsp;and the international Living Atlases</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout the&nbsp;Core Infrastructure Upgrade&nbsp;Project,&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;been&nbsp;working closely with GBIF&nbsp;and collaborating on&nbsp;a&nbsp;shared codebase. We’re&nbsp;also&nbsp;communicating&nbsp;with our user and stakeholder communities and the <a href="https://living-atlases.gbif.org/">international Living Atlases community. </a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Living Atlases is an international&nbsp;community of 26 biodiversity data infrastructures originally built on the&nbsp;ALA code base.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is a vibrant development community,&nbsp;sharing and&nbsp;contributing to a common code base. Most of the&nbsp;Living Atlas instances&nbsp;are nodes of GBIF&nbsp;and as such&nbsp;are stakeholders in the future of the infrastructure&nbsp;upgrade&nbsp;work. Throughout the project, the GBIF and ALA development teams have&nbsp;been&nbsp;keeping&nbsp;the&nbsp;Living Atlases community&nbsp;up-to-date and&nbsp;abreast&nbsp;of the changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Atlas of Living Australia and its large network of biodiversity data providers are helping our national
Environmental Biosecurity Office  (EBO) in the Department of  Agriculture, Water and the  Environment (DAWE) to protect  Australia’s flora and fauna from  exotic biosecurity threats. ]]></description>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/21280-ALA-Case-Study-Fact-Sheets-Biosecurity-V3-lowres.pdf"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Biosecurity-thumbnail.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44709" width="333" height="471" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Biosecurity-thumbnail.png 642w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Biosecurity-thumbnail-212x300.png 212w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/21280-ALA-Case-Study-Fact-Sheets-Biosecurity-V3-lowres.pdf">View or print this impact story as a PDF</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Keeping track of environmental pests and weeds is an ongoing challenge. Government biosecurity efforts aim to prevent, respond to and assist recovery from pests and diseases, with particular focus on the invasive species that threaten our environment and the economy. Early detection of exotic and introduced pest species is crucial to managing and eradicating invasive pests. </p>



<p>The EBO is charged with protecting Australia’s native flora, fauna and associated social amenity from the damaging effects of exotic pests, weeds and diseases that come  from overseas. One of their biggest challenges is knowing when pests and diseases first come into Australia and keeping track of their spread across the country. International border controls and quarantine measures are crucial elements for biosecurity control, but pests, weeds and diseases can still elude these controls. </p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) harnesses innovative solutions to complement existing methods of detection to further bolster biosecurity incursion surveillance. </p>



<p>For over ten years, the ALA – our national biodiversity data infrastructure – has been aggregating occurrence records of plant, animals and fungi species from over 700 data partners. In 2020, the ALA worked closely with DAWE to establish automatic alerts for targeted species on the National Priority List of Exotic Environmental Pests, Weeds and Diseases that are considered the greatest biosecurity risks to Australia. Using this list, the ALA set up an alert system. Now, when observations of those target species are uploaded to the database, an alert is sent to the EBO.</p>

Image credit: This image was taken in the USA and uploaded to iNaturalist by Chris Alice Kratzer (CC-BY-SA)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The value of the alert system has already been demonstrated regarding incursion reports in Victoria. In early 2020, a suspected sighting of the Asian shore crab by a member of the public on Port Phillip Bay in Victoria. This sighting was uploaded as a report into the ALA and provided the earliest available alert of the incursions. Early awareness of incursions into Australia by exotic species such as the Asian shore crab provide the best scenario for implementing successful management and eradication programs. If left unchecked exotic species can spread rapidly and compete with our native flora and fauna. </p>



<p>This episode demonstrated that the ALA notification system can provide over 9 months earlier warning of an incursion. Another example of the benefits of the ALA notification system, involving an exotic wasp, demonstrated that an incursion could be found 24-36 months earlier than the current reporting system. The notification system can also include a facility to validate and amend reports, which can be important for clarifying Australia’s pest status. Citizen science apps such as iNaturalist Australia, among many others, feed data into the ALA and directly contribute to the national biosecurity surveillance system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <em>“The ALA alert system is simple and is proving to be an important asset to our operational capability,” </em>said Andrew Pearce, from DAWE’s Environmental Biosecurity Office<em>. </em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“This is a layer of defence we haven’t had before and it has excellent potential for further development and expansion to deliver a low cost biosecurity surveillance and monitoring capability</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>The national biosecurity alert system is an excellent example of how the ALA is able to provide trusted biodiversity data to support environmental biosecurity program managers and help deliver better outcomes for Australian ecosystems and environments.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’re pleased to announce Professor Stephen van Leeuwen has been appointed to our Advisory Board and look forward to him joining our next meeting in July 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1024x731.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44704" width="380" height="270" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1536x1096.jpg 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1920x1370.jpg 1920w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>



<p>Professor Stephen van Leeuwen is a respected South West Boojarah Wardandi Noongar man whose Country is in the Busselton &#8211; Margaret River area of south west Western Australia.  He is a botanical ecologist, with a diverse research pedigree extending from threatened flora survey, fire ecology and threatened flora and fauna management through to biological survey, arid zone ecology, plant taxonomy and pollination biology.</p>



<p>As a botanical ecologist Stephen has had a long career working with biological data, from early work experience projects at the WA Herbarium, to being involved in the foundational WA Orchid Atlas and Banksia Atlas projects. He has also undertaken and managed botanical and biological surveys across the Pilbara, Gascoyne and neighbouring Western Deserts including fulfilling a leadership role in the Pilbara Biological Survey.</p>



<p>Prior to leaving the WA Public Service, Stephen was Assistant Director of Science in the Biodiversity and Conservation portfolio at the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, overseeing operations of the WA Herbarium and of the Western Australian biodiversity data portal &#8211; NatureMap. He also collaborated with the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute (WABSI) to establish the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/newsletter/ala-helps-improve-environmental-impact-assessments-in-western-australia/">Index of Biodiversity Surveys for Assessments</a> (IBSA) program and was also the WA champion for the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network’s (TERN) Surveillance (formerly AusPlots and Australian Transect Network) program.</p>



<p><strong>Building cultural competency and engagement with Indigenous Australians</strong></p>



<p>In a recent chat, Stephen shared with us his vision for his role with the ALA.</p>



<p>“I’m very keen to guide the ALA as it builds capacity and capabilities to be a culturally safe organisation that can respectfully capture, curate and support Traditional Knowledge (including language) and all it entails while ensuring the sovereignty of this knowledge, Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights and the mutual sharing of benefit derived from such knowledge,” Stephen said.</p>



<p>“I hope to build the Board’s cultural competency and engagement with Indigenous Australians to address the needs and aspirations of Indigenous Australians.&nbsp; In part I’ll do this by unlocking opportunities within my networks across Indigenous, academic, government and corporate sectors to build collaborations and minimise duplication of effort with respect to the participation and engagement of Indigenous Australians in the operations and activities of ALA.”</p>



<p><strong>Making a mark: some key priorities for his tenure with the ALA</strong></p>



<p>From a pragmatic on-ground perspective Stephen would like to see ALA’s activities continue to grow and service the needs of Indigenous land and sea Country managers and ranger teams, particularly in respect to the development of tools and applications that enable greater Traditional Knowledge capture, a reduction in the duplication of effort, and a greater emphasis on how Traditional Knowledge can help provide solutions to biodiversity conservation and land management challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While on the ALA Board, Stephen would like to ensure that the ALA becomes a culturally safe organisation which has a governance framework that supports Indigenous Australians and respectfully engages with them to capture Traditional Knowledge, including language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m keen to ensure that data is appropriately managed in terms of Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights, and that sovereignty of the data remains with the Knowledge holder,” he said.</p>



<p>“I am also keen to ensure that language is captured as part of Traditional Knowledge, as language is inherently linked to culture, and Country for Indigenous Australians.”</p>



<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>



<p>When not working Stephen enjoys botanising, fishing, pottering around the house and in his workshop and keeping abreast of Australian ecological literature.</p>



<p>Stephen attended Christian Brother College in Perth for his high school education.  He was a reasonable cross country and mid-distance runner and sprinter.  His finishing time for the 400m sprint at the Inter-school Catholic Colleges sports carnival set in 1985 still stands!</p>

<p>The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/collection/bhlau">biodiversitylibrary.org</a>) is the world’s largest online library of biodiversity literature and archival materials. The project is a global consortium of 523 contributing libraries who have together digitised over 59 million pages of the world’s biodiversity literature, all of which is freely accessible online, for everyone. </p>



<p>BHL Australia joined the global consortium in 2010.</p>



<h3 id="australian-biodiversity-literature">Australian biodiversity literature</h3>



<p>The BHL Australia project was one of the very first collaborative projects established by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/"> ala.org.au</a>). It is funded and operates as a co-investment between Museums Victoria and the ALA. </p>



<p>BHL Australia now supports 37 contributing organisations from every state and territory across the country. These include Australia’s state museums, herbaria and libraries, as well as smaller organisations such as royal societies, field naturalist clubs and other learned societies and community groups, who may never have had the resources to do this critical work without this support.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/duck-billed-platypus.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44689" width="328" height="271" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/duck-billed-platypus.png 743w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/duck-billed-platypus-300x248.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /><figcaption>Digitised copies of Australia’s biodiversity literature are now available through the BHL website. Each publication is assigned a digital object identifier (DOI) so it can be easily referenced. Image credit: BHL Australia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This work has unlocked treasures such as the first published descriptions the Echidna <a href="https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304529">https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304529</a> (1792), and the Platypus <a href="https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304567">https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304567 </a>(1799). These descriptions are now freely accessible, easily discoverable and persistently citable (via DOIs) on the BHL website.</p>



<h3 id="making-our-biodiversity-literature-accessible-and-discoverable">Making our biodiversity literature accessible and discoverable</h3>



<p>The BHL Australia team prioritises the digitisation of Australian-published biodiversity literature. The literature scanning operation is housed  at Melbourne Museum, where journals, monographs, archival material and grey literature are digitised. A significant proportion of the  canning, post-processing and metadata addition is undertaken by a team of dedicated BHL volunteers, many of whom have been with the project since the very beginning.</p>

<p>Providing free, online access to biodiversity literature greatly benefits researchers and decision makers working in the fields of taxonomy (naming and categorising species), ecology and conservation. In particular, providing access to the first descriptions of species greatly benefits the taxonomic community as all descriptions of new or revised species must be referenced to species concepts that have been put forward before. </p>



<p>Assigning DOIs (digital object identifiers) is an important component of BHL Australia’s work. DOIs make the historic literature discoverable; they provide a unique and permanent link to each scientific description online, enabling authors, publishers, and taxonomic databases (such as the ALA) to persistently link to (and find) that literature.</p>



<p>Historic literature is critical to our understanding of Australia’s biodiversity, particularly our understanding of changes in species distribution and  abundance. Since 2010, BHL Australia, and our evergrowing number of Australian contributors, have made almost 400,000 pages of Australia’s biodiversity literature openly accessible online. </p>

<p>In 2010, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) was established by the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) to provide researchers, decision makers and community groups a one-stop-shop for biodiversity data. There are now over 20 international Living Atlases based on the software platform originally developed by the ALA.</p>



<h2 id="the-ala-goes-global">The ALA goes global</h2>



<p>Within a few years of operation, the ALA rapidly established 100s of data partners across museums and herbaria, universities, government departments and community groups in Australia. Soon Australia’s biodiversity data were accessible online for ecoscience research, state and federal government environment and species conservation management programs. As the Australian node of GBIF – the Global Biodiversity Information Facility – the ALA supported the international community by sharing expertise and open software code.</p>



<p>In 2015, the ALA hosted the first international Living Atlases community meeting to respond to requests from countries around the world. This helped form the collaborative global community that now supports developers implementing the open source platform. The software code has been used to set up 27 installations around the world for national biodiversity databases as well as thematic, regional and institutional instances.</p>



<h2 id="the-international-living-atlases-community">The international Living Atlases community</h2>



<p>The Living Atlases platform enables countries to aggregate biodiversity data from multiple sources and supports integrated access to other biological and environmental information such as temperature, habitat etc.</p>



<p>Living Atlas community members continue to work collaboratively to share code and learn from experiences in establishing national biodiversity databases in their countries. They have organised technical training sessions and presented at numerous international meetings. As a result of these and other efforts, an increasing number of GBIF nodes and other organisations have implemented the platform. The Living Atlases community website offers full technical documentation, news from across the community and a current and complete list of participating countries.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Atlas of Living Australia has been aggregating biodiversity data for over 10 years. But how did we come to be, what have we delivered to date, and what challenges are we tackling next?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.9.e65023">new paper released today in Biodiversity Data Journal </a>written by Lee Belbin, Ely Wallis, Donald Hobern and Andre Zerger maps out the ALA’s past, present and future.</p>



<p>“The ALA was really a front-runner in the biodiversity data space. Early and ongoing investment from the Australian Government National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy was timely and has had a lasting impact on how biodiversity data are managed and accessed on a global scale,” says ALA Director Dr Andre Zerger.</p>



<p>“We thought it was time to document this history and achievement and I believe this paper will become a critical reference for the international biodiversity data community.&#8221; </p>



<p><strong>Looking back – our origin story</strong></p>



<p>Let’s set the scene – it’s the late 1990s. You are a taxonomist&nbsp;trying to find specimen data for a research project. To find this information you must personally contact managers of collections, undertake formal loans of specimens from many museums, or travel across the country and internationally to get access to where specimens of interest have been recorded. After months of letters, emails and phone calls, you’re finally able to analyse the data and start your research.</p>



<p>This is a process that was kept on repeat for decades. Finding and accessing biodiversity data was a major challenge, it wasn’t accessible or shared between organisations.</p>



<p>By the mid-2000s, the research community saw opportunity in emerging digital technologies and significant collaborative initiatives were underway to start to share data. Cue the review of national research infrastructure. The findings of this review led to the Australian Government accepting the proposal of the natural history collections community – to build on the collaboration already well advanced to create a single online platform that would harmonises all existing databases.</p>



<p>In May 2006, 25 representatives from across biological collections met at the Australian Museum in Sydney. Here, the group identified the significant benefits of an aggregated database and the Atlas of Living Australia was formed.</p>



<p><strong>Here we are now – Australia’s national biodiversity database</strong></p>



<p>Flash forward to the present day, we now successfully aggregate and harmonise biodiversity data from not only museum and herbarium collections, but also government departments, research institutions, Indigenous knowledge holders, community groups, universities, and individuals.</p>



<p>In 2020, we celebrated our 10 years of making biodiversity information accessible to all. Our celebrations were particularly focussed on thanking the founding partners and biodiversity data providers that helped us reach where we are today.</p>



<p>In the 10 years since our launch, we have achieved many milestones and enabled impact across the globe. There are now more than 90 million occurrence records of 110,000 species, 5000 species lists, 2000 biodiversity-related projects, 500 environmental layers. We have also enabled a number of biodiversity data portals by making the underlying ALA code openly available.</p>



<p>We have also taken a leadership role globally through the Living Atlases program. There are instances of ALA software delivering national biodiversity capabilities in 24 countries around the world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="903" height="640" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/11/10-stats-for-10-years_image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44393" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/11/10-stats-for-10-years_image.png 903w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/11/10-stats-for-10-years_image-300x213.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/11/10-stats-for-10-years_image-768x544.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /></figure>



<p><strong>What does the future hold?</strong></p>



<p>Following our Future Directions National Consultation process in 2019, we began to shift our focus to the new challenges ahead.</p>



<p>The consultation process highlighted how far the ALA has come and the impact we have had on the way Australian biodiversity data are utilised. However, the consultation also highlighted some areas of improvement.</p>



<p>To reach our full potential and continue delivering innovative data solutions, the ALA will have a future focus on projects that aim to:</p>



<ul><li>increase data quality within the ALA</li><li>deliver a diverse range of data to support biodiversity reporting</li><li>harmonise industry data gathered through surveys with existing data available through museums, herbaria, and state data programmes</li><li>take a leadership role in facilitating cooperation and collaboration between institutions</li><li>integrate additional data streams, such as images, genomics, sounds recordings and environmental assessment data to paint a more extensive picture of Australian biodiversity.</li></ul>



<p>We have already embarked on several projects to transform the way people access biodiversity data through the ALA. These include our recently released <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/data-quality-project/">data profiles functionality</a> and a <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/current-projects/core-infrastructure-upgrade-project/">core infrastructure upgrade project</a> that is being delivered in close partnership with GBIF, which will improve alignment between ALA and GBIF systems and data.</p>



<p>We are excited to see what the future holds and look forward to the continued relationship with our founding partners and others who have become part of the community along the way. These relationships allow us to tackle future challenges collaboratively, and to provide solutions with wide reaching benefit and impact.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;recent study by Ross Crates, a scientist at ANU’s Difficult Bird Research Group, explains why Regent Honeyeaters are changing their songs. More importantly, Ross wanted to find out what the change means for their future.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Ross-Crates_Regent-Honeyeater.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44646" width="371" height="371" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Ross-Crates_Regent-Honeyeater.jpg 1000w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Ross-Crates_Regent-Honeyeater-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Ross-Crates_Regent-Honeyeater-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Ross-Crates_Regent-Honeyeater-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /><figcaption>Ross Crates in the field with an endangered Regent Honeyeater.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4 id="australias-most-endangered-songbird">Australia&#8217;s most endangered songbird</h4>



<p>Australia’s most threatened songbird, the Regent Honeyeater (<em><a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:83225d29-264f-4236-9dda-32f7d60fb3af">Anthochaera (Xanthomyza) phrygia</a></em>), is changing its bird call.</p>



<p>A changing call makes it difficult for Regent Honeyeaters to find each other and breed. It also poses a particular challenge for the researchers like Ross and his team. The inconsistency in bird call means it is difficult to research these birds and protect them.</p>



<p>The Regent Honeyeater was commonly found throughout Australia’s south-east, but due to land clearing since the 1960s, it is now on the verge of extinction (critically endangered in NSW and QLD, endangered in ACT and SA). The most recent data suggests there are probably less than 350 individuals remaining. This makes it more important than ever for researchers to investigate ways to protect them.</p>



<h4 id="can-songs-provide-insights-into-species-decline">Can songs provide insights into species decline?</h4>



<p>To address the rapid decline in species numbers, Ross and his team are looking into many different factors affecting Regent Honeyeater populations. These include habitat requirements, the range of Eucalyptus trees they like to feed on, and genetic analysis. He has also been listening to the honeyeater’s bird songs.</p>



<p>“We wanted to investigate the impact of population decline on the songs they sing, the complexity of the song and also their individual fitness,” said Ross.</p>



<p>“We were particularly looking at the male birds because the song is a crucial tool to attract a mate.”</p>



<h4 id="finding-the-data-live-recordings-and-the-back-catalogue"><strong>Finding the data: live recordings and the back catalogue</strong></h4>



<p>Ross pulled together lots of Regent Honeyeater data from surveys and BirdLife Australia sightings. This data was used to assess distribution and density of the remaining wild populations. For the sound recordings of the honeyeaters’ contemporary songs, the research team recorded birds in the wild and in captivity. They then used the ALA to find historical song recordings of wild males from 1986 to 2011.</p>



<p>“The ALA provides access to over 5,200 sound files of bird songs. This was incredibly useful for us as we could make comparisons and work out how regent honeyeater songs have changed over time,” said Ross.</p>

<p>Ross and his team listened to and coded over 228 songs. They found the two main groups of wild birds had their own distinct songs: The Blue Mountains song and the Northern Tablelands song.</p>



<p>They also found that some birds within each group sang different songs. Some sang a shortened version of their group’s song, but others copied the songs of much more abundant birds, such as the Little Wattlebird, Noisy Friarbird, Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater, Pied Currawong, and Eastern Rosella.</p>



<p>“We found that Regent Honeyeaters were copying other birds and singing atypical songs, if their population density was low in that area. Males that sang other species&#8217; songs had significantly fewer conspecifics (birds of the same species) living close by, than males that sang species-specific songs,” said Ross.</p>



<p>“We also found that birds that sang different songs were less likely to be paired with a female in that breeding season.”</p>



<h4 id="impact-of-this-research"><strong>Impact of this research</strong></h4>



<p>In this research paper, Ross’ team have come closer to understanding how animal cultures are maintained, the conditions under which they are lost, and the impact this has on both species’ evolution and conservation.</p>



<p>“We found rare evidence showing that a severe decline in population size and density is associated with the loss of vocal culture in a wild animal population. This is similar to the loss of human languages globally,” said Ross.</p>



<p>“Also, for the first time, we’ve shown that birds in very small groups in the wild suffer from significant changes that affect their fitness to reproduce. And these changes may speed up the decline in numbers.”</p>



<h4 id="changing-the-way-we-monitor-endangered-bird-populations"><strong>Changing the way we monitor endangered bird populations</strong></h4>



<p>By researching the endangered Regent Honeyeater and their changing songbook, Ross and his team have found that the birds are changing their songs to learn songs of more abundant species. This may be a precursor to extinction in already declining populations.</p>



<p>“This approach – where we monitor how birds are changing their songs – may provide a new way for assessing the trajectory of population decline, especially for species whose populations are very difficult to monitor in traditional ways,” said Ross.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Thomas-mesaglio_3_image-credit-Kate-Mesaglio_cropped.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44635" width="466" height="451" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Thomas-mesaglio_3_image-credit-Kate-Mesaglio_cropped.jpg 750w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Thomas-mesaglio_3_image-credit-Kate-Mesaglio_cropped-300x290.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /><figcaption>Thomas Mesaglio in action recording a species observation for iNaturalist Australia.

<p>Thomas Mesaglio, an environmental scientist from the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of New South Wales, has a keen interest in how citizen scientists across Australia are helping large scale ecological studies.</p>



<p>In his recent review of iNaturalist Australia, Thomas measured a number of changes across the platform. He looked at the increase in the volume of data being uploaded, numbers of users and the different taxonomic and spatial data being recorded. He also showcased some applications of iNaturalist data for species conservation and monitoring.</p>



<p>“iNaturalist is an excellent platform for recording observations of species and it has contributed enormously to our biodiversity data holdings in Australia,” said Thomas.</p>



<p>“It’s a great platform to increase public participation in natural science.” he said.</p>



<p>The data collected by citizen scientists through iNaturalist is made available online through the Atlas of Living Australia and becomes part of the ever-increasing Australian biodiversity data repository. Researchers and people in government working on environment policy use biodiversity data in the ALA to inform many research studies and government programs in ecology, land management, species conservation and biosecurity measures.</p>



<p><strong>iNaturalist Australia in numbers</strong></p>



<p>iNaturalist is one of the most popular biodiversity citizen science platforms globally, with more than 1.4 million users having contributed over 54 million observations. Australia contributes the most observations in the southern hemisphere, and is in the top four contributing nations globally. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="949" height="534" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/iNat-infographic_2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44638" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/iNat-infographic_2.png 949w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/iNat-infographic_2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/iNat-infographic_2-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px" /></figure>



<p>In 2019, the ALA collaborated with the global iNaturalist Network to set up iNaturalist Australia. In two years there has been a huge growth in the number of Australian users and in the number of species observations recorded through the platform.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="638" height="424" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Number-of-observers-and-species-iNat-since-2008.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44630" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Number-of-observers-and-species-iNat-since-2008.png 638w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/Number-of-observers-and-species-iNat-since-2008-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /><figcaption>The number of observers and observed species on iNaturalist Australia since 2008.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Helping to protect our threatened species and manage invasive species</strong></p>



<p>Data collected through iNaturalist Australia is uploaded automatically to the ALA, where it is made accessible and usable by researchers and decision-makers. Citizen science data uploaded through iNaturalist (and other apps) are particularly useful for the monitoring and conservation of threatened species.</p>



<p>Citizen science data are also used to help model the distribution of invasive species and assess their impact on our ecology and economy. Alongside other apps like FeralScan and MyPestGuide, iNaturalist is well positioned to provide data to help with pest surveillance for biosecurity programs.</p>

<p><strong>Citizens are our data collection powerhouse</strong></p>



<p>Thomas has used citizen science data in many of his research projects and sees wide ranging benefits of digital platforms such as iNaturalist Australia and national repositories like the ALA.</p>



<p>“Citizen scientists are able to observe species in locations not covered by research or government surveys such as on private land,&#8221; said Thomas.</p>



<p>“The combination of a willing workforce of citizen scientists and the digital platforms that enable their contributions to be shared and utilised is of huge benefit to ecology researchers and government conservation, land management and biosecurity programs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Citizen science data are typically collected and verified at little or no cost. Thomas’ paper highlights that the iNaturalist model, where citizen science data is integrated with professional data collection, greatly reduces the costs of ecological monitoring and expedites scientific discoveries.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="602" height="576" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/04/iNat-infographic-data-collection.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-44632"/><figcaption>As more taxonomic experts join iNaturalist, more observations will increase the quality of the data, providing more data for ecological and conservation research questions in Australia.</figcaption></figure></div>
