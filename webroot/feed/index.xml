<p>The <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/abdmp/">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program</a> (ABDMP) was developed to promote and improve the scientific understanding of Australia’s rare and remarkable biodiversity. In our third year of the program, the ABDMP was expanded to include both a ‘general’ funding stream and a ‘biosecurity-specific’ funding stream. Through a competitive application process, we are pleased to announce the successful biosecurity projects for 2024. The general round of projects will be announced shortly.</p>



<p><strong>Successful Biosecurity Projects:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://nre.tas.gov.au/biosecurity-tasmania">Biosecurity Tasmania</a>:</strong> This project will mobilise more than 73,000 invertebrate specimen records from the Tasmanian Agriculture Invertebrate Collection (TAIC). This includes more than 450 type specimens and unique records from Macquarie Island.  Cumulatively these records will provide a significant increase in spatial areas of many Tasmanian species not currently represented in the ALA, accelerating the documentation of Australia’s invertebrate fauna.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dbca.wa.gov.au/science/research-tools-and-repositories/western-australian-herbarium"><strong>Western Australian Herbarium –</strong> <strong>Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions</strong></a><strong>.</strong> To improve the detection of invasive plants across Western Australia, this project will capture high-resolution images of herbarium specimens and mobilise this information to the ALA.  These images, along with existing data for 36,700 specimens and an additional 800 to be digitised, will be made publicly available. This will greatly improve the ability of land managers and biosecurity groups to identify and manage invasive species.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://pir.sa.gov.au/research">Primary Industries and Regions South Australia- South Australia Research and Development Institute (SARDI)- Aquatic and Livestock Sciences</a>.</strong> SARDI holds valuable data on invasive, introduced, and native marine species collected in South Australia and beyond. Currently, these records (particularly those for invasive species) are inaccessible to the public. This project will mobilise this data by extracting it from SARDI databases, ensuring quality control, and making it open access through the ALA.</li>
</ul>



<p>We congratulate the successful biosecurity projects for 2024 and thank our review panel for their time and expertise in evaluating many high-calibre applications for this funding stream.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Did you know that small bodies of water in your city, like ponds or retention basins, play a crucial role in the environment? These urban wetlands are vital for supporting clean water, healthy ecosystems, and even bird migration. However, urban wetlands are often highly modified or constructed bodies of water, and are therefore seen as less “valuable” from an urban planning lens in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a partnership between the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), the <a href="https://aurin.org.au/">Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN)</a>, <a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">BirdLife Australia</a> and <a href="https://federation.edu.au/">Federation University</a>, a tool was created to raise awareness of the importance of wetlands in urban environments. The team used open-source citizen-science data to quantify the values of urban wetlands across Victoria, including those that have previously been overlooked. This information was collated into a publicly available online mapping tool, ‘<ins><a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/">Valuing Urban Wetlands</a></ins>’.</p>



<p><strong>The online tool</strong></p>



<p>The tool integrates waterbird and landscape data through an online portal called ‘<a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/"><em>Valuing Urban Wetlands</em></a><em>.</em>’ Waterbird data collected through citizen science and professional science was accessed via the ALA, <a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">BirdLife Australia</a> and <a href="https://ebird.org/region/AU">eBird</a> and overlayed with open landscape data to create metrics for assessing wetland health and importance. The tool focuses on the Greater Melbourne region, but the methodology can be applied to other regions in the future</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="506" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-1024x506.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-49504" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-1024x506.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-768x379.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-1536x759.jpg 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-2048x1012.jpg 2048w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Valuing-Urban-wetlands-1920x949.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/">Valuing Urban Wetlands</a> online tool interface.</p>



<p>Anyone can access the <ins><a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/">Valuing Urban Wetlands</a></ins> online portal. You can enter a wetland name or scroll across the map to zoom into an area and click on a wetland of interest to generate an area report. The report will provide a list of all frog and waterbird species present at this wetland (based on the data sources listed above) as well as the number of threatened species for these taxa.</p>

<p><strong>Case study: Latham’s Snipe <em>(<a href="https://www.birdsinbackyards.net/Charadriiformes/Scolopacidae/Gallinago/Gallinago-hardwickii">Gallinago hardwickii</a>)</em></strong></p>



<p>Latham&#8217;s Snipe is a migratory shorebird that relies on wetland habitats. It breeds in Japan and migrates to Australia for the non-breeding season. It is a cryptic bird and difficult to observe, but research has revealed very high numbers of snipe in some Victorian urban wetlands. Through the online tool developed through this project, wetlands important to support Latham’s Snipe are identified and annual numbers recorded at these wetlands are included in wetland report.</p>



<p><strong>Project Impacts</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Raise awareness of urban wetlands:</strong> The project has created a publicly accessible online system that highlights the importance of urban wetlands for biodiversity conservation. This can raise awareness among policymakers, planners, and the general public to give greater consideration to urban wetlands are resources of high biodiversity value. </li>



<li><strong>Improved decision-making:</strong> By providing quantitative data on the value of urban wetlands, the project can inform better decision-making related to land use and development. This ultimately is aimed to lead to better protection of these crucial habitats.</li>



<li><strong>Standardised metrics</strong>: The project has developed a standardised metrics based on citizen-science data for assessing urban wetland value. These metrics can facilitate comparisons across different wetlands and regions.</li>



<li><strong>Citizen science integration: </strong>The project incorporates data from citizen science initiatives like the ALA, Birdlife Australia and eBird. This can empower citizen scientists and contribute valuable data for conservation efforts.</li>



<li><strong>Improved monitoring of key bird species:</strong> Using the Latham&#8217;s Snipe as a case study, this project demonstrates the potential for improving understanding of declining species&#8217; distribution and habitat use in urban areas.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>”Wetlands in urban areas are often overlooked in protection efforts due to a misconception that they are weedy, littered swamps that have low conservation value. However, they provide important refuge habitat for a range of species in our cities, including the Vulnerable Latham’s Snipe. We developed this tool to help raise awareness of the biodiversity value of small urban wetlands by presenting snapshots of data recorded by citizen scientists,</em>” said Dr Birgita Hansen, Project Lead and Senior Research Fellow at Federation University. </p>

<p>Caitlin Ramsay completed the <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/">CSIRO </a>National Collections and Marine Infrastructure Indigenous Scholarship Program (NISP) in 2022-23. In that time Caitlin worked with the Atlas of Living Australia&#8217;s (ALA) Science and Decision Support team on a project focused on mapping invasive species and how they have moved across Australia over time. Since then, Caitlin has come full circle, joining the <a href="https://arga.org.au/">Australian Reference Genome Atlas</a> (ARGA) team hosted by the ALA.  </p>



<p>We chatted with Caitlin to learn more about her experiences in participating in the NISP internship program and what she&#8217;s working on today.</p>



<p><strong>What initially drew you to participate in the CSIRO NISP program?</strong></p>



<p>When I first stumbled upon the CSIRO NISP program, I was studying a dual degree of bioinformatics engineering and ecology and up until that time had only very basic exposure to using my data analysis skills on environmental data. The description of the CSIRO NISP program through the ALA promoted using data analysis and producing data visualisations using biodiversity data and I immediately thought this would be the perfect opportunity to combine my two passions and learn how to make some cool graphs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/02/cane-toads-final-1024x768.png" alt="" class="wp-image-48092" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/02/cane-toads-final-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/02/cane-toads-final-300x225.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/02/cane-toads-final-768x576.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/02/cane-toads-final-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/02/cane-toads-final-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/02/cane-toads-final-1920x1440.png 1920w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/02/cane-toads-final-640x480.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Data visualisation produced by Caitlin in her NISP internship with the ALA using galah-python. </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How did participating in the program help prepare you for your current role within the ARGA team? What are you currently working on?</strong></p>



<p>Currently I’m working with the ARGA team to help design and implement the user interface of the app’s website. Although this is quite different to the work that I was originally carrying out in the NISP program, learning how to work collaboratively in a team environment and achieve various goals under the guidance and support of my supervisors proved valuable in preparing me for my current role. I was also able to work on a few different tasks for the duration of the NISP program such as assisting in the development of <a href="https://galah.ala.org.au/Python/">galah-python</a> which improved upon my software development skills. The NISP program also allowed me to become more confident in my skillset and learn how to approach and solve novel problems, which are all useful in helping me to complete my day-to-day tasks within the ARGA team.</p>



<p><strong>What made you want to come back to CSIRO as a full-time employee after your internship?</strong></p>



<p>I had an absolute deadly time during my internship mainly due to the stimulating and rewarding work I was undertaking but even more so because of the friendly and welcoming people I got to work with. The culture that the ALA and CSIRO foster is unmatched, and I definitely grew to miss the company of the people I worked alongside which is why I reached out to see if there were any opportunities available after I had graduated!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Square-posts-59-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-49485" style="width:496px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Square-posts-59-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Square-posts-59-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Square-posts-59-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Square-posts-59-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Square-posts-59.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Caitlin after graduating from her double degree from UNSW.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to other students considering undertaking a CSIRO NISP internship?</strong></p>



<p>If you’re thinking about applying, just do it! I almost didn’t apply because I didn’t believe I had enough experience, or a developed enough skillset but I’m so glad that I ended up applying in the end. It’s such an amazing learning opportunity and super cool experience being able to work alongside experts and hone your skills; so why try it out!</p>



<p>Applications for the 2024-25 CSIRO NISP program will open in August. Keep an eye out on <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/internships/">ALA Internship Opportunities page</a> for further details and updates. </p>

<p>Today is World Turtle Day! Australia is home to 23 species of freshwater turtles which you can discover through the <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/ef8440de-c558-4fdf-9e4c-635a7871f01b#overview" data-type="link" data-id="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/ef8440de-c558-4fdf-9e4c-635a7871f01b#overview">ALA</a>! We’re celebrating the day by chatting to Dr Ricky Spencer &#8211; Associate Professor from <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/schools/sosc/research/zoological_sciences">Western Sydney University</a> who co-leads the <a href="https://1millionturtles.com/">1 Million Turtles</a> (1MT) citizen science project.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Where did the idea for the 1 Million Turtles project come from?</strong></p>



<p>The story starts with a stark realisation. In 2015, a mysterious virus swept through the Bellinger River in northern New South Wales, wiping out a staggering 90% of the critically endangered <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https:/biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/e8b0899e-0148-45ba-b2eb-2c42c3ad3d96">Bellinger River Snapping Turtle (</a><em><a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https:/biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/e8b0899e-0148-45ba-b2eb-2c42c3ad3d96">Myuchelys georgesi)</a> </em>population. This devastating event highlighted the urgent need for large-scale freshwater turtle conservation efforts. Researchers from leading Australian universities knew traditional methods wouldn&#8217;t suffice. They needed a way to harness the power of the public, a way to give everyone a voice in turtle conservation. Enter citizen science, and the innovative 1MT project was born.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-49463" style="width:1001px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1920x1440.jpg 1920w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-640x480.jpg 640w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bellinger River Snapping Turtle (<em>Myuchelys georgesi)</em> Photo Credit Darren Fielder CC BY NC.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q: What role does citizen science play in this project?</strong></p>



<p>Citizen science is at the very core of 1MT. Why? Because freshwater turtles are shy and elusive creatures. Traditional research methods often lack the necessary scope to track their populations effectively. Imagine the difference millions of eyes across the country can make! Through the user-friendly <a href="https://turtlesat.org.au/turtlesat/default.aspx">TurtleSAT app</a>, citizen scientists become data collection heroes.</p>



<p><strong>Q: What kind of turtle data are you interested in collecting through the TurtleSAT app?</strong></p>



<p>TurtleSAT is more than just a reporting tool. Inspired by the Bellinger River crisis, the app is designed to capture a wide range of turtle data. See a healthy turtle basking on a log? Snap a picture and submit it through TurtleSAT. Witness a turtle struggling to cross a busy road? Report the location and type of road within the app. Notice unusual behaviour, like a turtle with lesions or difficulty moving? Document your observations with photos or videos and submit them through TurtleSAT. This detailed data allows researchers to identify threats, track populations, and understand the overall health of freshwater turtle populations.</p>



<p>But 1MT goes beyond mere data collection. The program is passionate about transforming participants from observers to active conservation partners. This is where the exciting turtle data comes in. Citizen scientists are trained to collect information beyond sightings. They learn nest monitoring and protection protocols, conduct standardised surveys for invasive species like foxes (think National Nest Predation Survey), and even analyse data through TurtleSAT. This fosters a sense of ownership and empowers communities to become active conservation stewards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="392" height="839" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Turtlesatbbb.png" alt="" class="wp-image-49477" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Turtlesatbbb.png 392w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/05/Turtlesatbbb-140x300.png 140w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Q: What impacts have you seen from the 1MT project so far?</strong></p>



<p>The impact of the 1MT project has been truly shell-ebrating! Winning the prestigious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNR4EqScorM">Eureka Prize for Innovation in Citizen Science in 2023</a> served as a major validation and a springboard for further growth. The recognition brought well-deserved attention to the project&#8217;s innovative approach and its crucial role in turtle conservation.</p>



<p>Another exciting aspect of 1MT is the collaboration with the <a href="https://www.nativetitlesa.org/pbcs/ngarrindjeri-aboriginal-corporation-rntbc/">Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal Corporation</a>. This partnership aims to record the rich knowledge and history of turtles held by the Ngarrindjeri people, the Traditional Owners of the land. Integrating Indigenous knowledge systems with scientific research offers invaluable insights into turtle ecology and conservation practices.</p>



<p>So, what exciting discoveries have emerged from the mountains of data collected so far? Well, the results are nothing short of fascinating! Citizen science data has played a key role in identifying hotspots of turtle mortality on roads. This has led to targeted signage, infrastructure improvements, and the creation of &#8220;Turtle-Safe&#8221; roads. Additionally, the data has informed conservation advice documents for numerous turtle species under the <em>EPBC Act</em>, a critical step towards their protection.</p>



<p>Beyond scientific advancements, the program has fostered a positive shift in public attitudes and behaviours towards turtles. Community initiatives like Turtle Islands – safe havens built by local communities for nesting turtles – showcase the power of collective action.</p>



<p><strong>Q: How can the public get involved?</strong></p>



<p>The 1MT project is actively seeking new citizen scientists to join the movement. How can you get involved? Download the <a href="https://turtlesat.org.au/turtlesat/default.aspx">TurtleSAT app</a>, report your turtle sightings, and participate in data collection efforts. You can also spread awareness about the project, support fundraising initiatives, or even explore volunteering opportunities with local turtle conservation groups. Become a champion for freshwater turtles!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the March 2024 edition of our Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) newsletter.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In this issue we are proud to be launching Round 3 of the ALA Australian Biodiversity Mobilisation Program. This is one of ALA’s flagship programs that was designed three years ago to provide a mechanism to support the digitisation and provision of important biodiversity that may otherwise not be provided to the ALA. In the first two years the program has supported 12 remarkable teams to digitally enable their data and make it available to the ALA as open data, and through that effort internationally to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. These <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/abdmp/">12 current projects </a>span a range of incredible institutions, species, and provide important geographic coverage. This year we are excited to have secured additional support from <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/about/challenges-missions/biosecurity">CSIRO’s Catalysing Australia’s Biosecurity initiative</a>. This will provide additional focus on species of biosecurity concern which we know will generate additional excitement around the program, and deliver data to the ALA that assists Australia’s biosecurity sector to better assess risk, and mitigations.</p>



<p>ALA’s <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/ALA-Strategy-2020-2025.pdf">Strategy 2020-2025</a> has an action to ‘establish data priorities to ensure Australia has a nationally comprehensive, representative and adequate biodiversity data infrastructure’. In addition to supporting those parts of the biodiversity data sector that may be resource constrained, the Data Mobilisation Program has become an important mechanism for independently identifying data priorities, whether geographic or taxonomic and starting to fill these gaps in our national biodiversity data system. The existing 12 projects, and approximately nine projects we expect to fund in 2024 will play a fundamental role in ensuring the Australian biodiversity research, management and policy landscape has access to the best available data. The launch of Round 3 also provides a timely reminder that we are keen to grow this important national program through <a href="https://ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/02/ALA-Australian-Biodiversity-Data-Mobilisation-Program-Prospectus-December-2022.pdf">partnerships</a> with government, industry and the research sector so please do reach out if you’d like to play a supporting role in future years.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy our March Newsletter.</p>

<p>19<sup>th</sup> March is the perfect day to celebrate and share some facts about tax(onomy) in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)!  We sat down with Cam Slatyer who is a Project Manager in the ALA to chat about his extensive experience and incredible stories working across taxonomy throughout his career. </p>



<p><strong>Q: How is taxonomy evolving in the ALA and what’s your role in this project?</strong></p>



<p>A: The ALA has a fascinating challenge with taxonomy. We bring together data from Australia and the world, historic and new. Taxonomy is a living, evolving science where names are proposed by scientists as theories, some are accepted, and some aren’t. Names change over time.&nbsp; Take the Platypus, which has the scientific name (<em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus). </em>When it was first described by science, it was called <em>(Platypus anatinus</em>), but someone discovered that the name was already being used for a group of beetles (and still is). You can’t have that in taxonomy. The International Codes of Nomenclature (which definitely aren’t like the Pirate Code in <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>) try to stop that sort of thing. It’s like not having two people in the same friendship with the same name: they end up getting called Cam 1 and Cam 2 or Blue because one has red hair. This has meant that the poor old Platypus has a scientific name that means duck-like bird-snout&#8230; which is a pretty good description really.</p>



<p>In the ALA, we need to cope with all names,  for everything from viruses to mountain ash to make sure that data end up under the best available name. That has been a challenge ever since the ALA first started, but now with more than 135 million records, it is vast. My job with my colleagues, is to improve it. We rely heavily on the Australian Government’s Australian Biological Resources Study, who have spent the last few years putting together a National Species List, as well as the Australian Plant Census, run by all the herbaria in Australia, to get our names. We also take names from the New Zealand Organism Register and the International Catalogue of Life to make names match. So our job for the next year or so, is removing things like duplicates, adding missing names and improving name matching. One of our biggest challenges is the differences between Australia and New Zealand. It isn’t just the All Blacks we need to keep an eye on! There are important scientific reasons why Australia and New Zealand have different names for the same things, but we are trying to make sure the New Zealand species have New Zealand names and the Australian species have Australian names.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Tell us about your experience working in taxonomy!</strong></p>



<p>A: I’m not a taxonomist, but I’ve been lucky enough to work alongside taxonomists for many years. I’ve seen an amazing array of new species and been privileged enough to have three species named after me. My favourite experience was working on heritage listing mound springs, which are incredibly important and unique freshwater springs in Queensland and South Australia, having species that are often found nowhere else on Earth. I was accompanying a freshwater snail taxonomist, looking for new species and checking on existing ones. We’d been through dozens of springs and hadn’t found any new species, which was enormously frustrating. I was looking for frogs while my colleagues were sieving for snails (mound spring snails are tiny). I found these little black dots on some leaves and showed them to the scientist. Turns out it was the only new species of the trip, were described and then immediately identified as endangered. Not bad for a frog person!</p>



<p><strong>Q: What are some current challenges in the field of taxonomy?</strong></p>



<p>A: Sadly, the biggest challenge is the same as when I first started working with taxonomists in the late 1990s. We are running out of taxonomists, which is frightening given they are essential for identifying threats such as the recent Varroa mite incursion, or understanding the status of threatened species. Over a third of the taxonomists in Australia are voluntary – retirees or people doing taxonomy in their spare time. Government funding for taxonomy hasn’t been increased since 1974 and museums and herbaria are the mainstay of our capacity.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Do you have a favourite species?</strong></p>



<p>A: Australia has around 154,000 named species. I think I have new favourites as I learn about them. But most of my regular favourites are frogs, including the stuttering frog (<em>Mixophyes balbus</em>) or bats like the golden-tipped bat (<em>Phoniscus papuensis</em>)!</p>

<p></p>



<p>What’s the difference between<a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/ALA_DR656_1862#classification"></a><a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/d1a27333-c288-46d5-a034-f42920ddb1b8#overview">(<em>Tyto novaehollandiae kimberli)</em></a> and <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/2c30d58b-572b-4dab-8644-b222c28eb0ec#overview"><em>(Tyto novaehollandiae castanops)</em></a>? Although these two birds are similar, they are different sub-species of Masked Owls that are found on completely opposite ends of Australia, and as such have different taxonomic names!</p>

<p>Taxonomy is the scientific practice of naming, describing and classifying organisms, and is the fundamental basis for how data in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) are organised. Species taxonomy is continuously evolving based on new scientific discoveries (new species being described), as well as techniques such as genetic sequencing, bioinformatics and advanced imaging which can change the way researchers understand existing species leading to re-classification.</p>



<p>To accurately reflect current taxonomy of species listed within the ALA, we are continuously working to improve our ‘taxonomic backbone’ i.e. source material for which species in the ALA are structured.</p>



<p><strong>How species are structured in the ALA</strong></p>



<p>The ALA&nbsp;<a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000261677-taxonomy-in-the-ala">taxonomic backbone</a>&nbsp;is principally sourced from the&nbsp;<a href="https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/">National Species List (NSL)</a>, but we also draw names from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nzor.org.nz/">New Zealand Organism Register (NZOR)</a>&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.catalogueoflife.org/">Catalogue of Life (CoL)</a>. We have recently undergone significant changes to align our taxonomic backbone to better fit current scientific names recognised in Australia. This reduces duplication of species listings in the ALA and improves accuracy and navigation when users are searching for new species or threatened species records.</p>



<p><strong>What’s the numbers?</strong></p>



<p>In May 2023, the ALA had 154,506 species of animals (with 2,400 unranked animal species listings) and 48,972 species of plants (with 5,555 unranked plant species listings), giving a total of ~ 211,000 plant and animal species recorded in the ALA. Unranked species are species that either cannot be placed in the taxonomy or have been added to enable data matching to an existing species.</p>



<p>Through our recent work to improve ALA’s taxonomic backbone removing duplication and aligning to current taxonomy, we have reduced these listings to 124,999 animal species (with 11 unranked) and 41,740 plant species (with 37 unranked). Whilst improving ALA’s taxonomy is an evolving process, this represents a major removal of duplication and error fixing in the ALA’s species listings.</p>



<p><strong>What do these changes look like in the ALA?</strong></p>



<p>Though much of the work to refresh the ALA taxonomic backbone is in the back-end, here are some visible changes that you may notice across the ALA:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Improving synonym matching</strong> – With thousands of unique species in Australia, and more being described and named every year, many species are known by more than one name. While the ALA uses the NSL to source synonyms for species (different names referring to the same speices), there are still differences in names, particularly those used internationally. For example, the <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/0d3239e3-927e-43c1-9d65-4a5e75fe33d3">Green Tree Frog (<em>Litoria caerulea</em>)</a> is known internationally as (<em>Ranoidea careulea)</em> in data sets such as iNaturalist. The changed taxonomy will now mean that many of these synonyms will match to the scientific name that species are most commonly known by in Australia.</li>



<li><strong>Placing names in the taxonomic hierarchy</strong> – The ALA places species within a taxonomy tree, like a family tree. The taxonomic backbone refresh means that we have resolved many previous errors and repeat entries for invertebrates, vertebrates and vascular plants.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Correcting species entries</strong> – We have taken steps to remove duplications and unresolved synonyms in the ALA by reducing the number of sources for our taxonomic backbone. We have therefore removed the Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota (CAAB) and the NZOR as a source of names for vertebrates and invertebrates. We have also consolidated all minor sources into four edited lists that add names used in legislation or species management that do not occur in the NSL – these include a conservation list, a migratory species list, a pests and weeds list and a biosecurity invasive list (species not found in Australia).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="737" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/02/Taxonomy-ala-1024x737.jpg" alt="the taxonomic classification of the masked owl, shown in the form of a hierarchy" class="wp-image-49250" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/02/Taxonomy-ala-1024x737.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/02/Taxonomy-ala-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/02/Taxonomy-ala-768x552.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/02/Taxonomy-ala.jpg 1297w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Example of classifying species in a hierarchy on the ALA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>



<p>We will continue to further improve the ALA taxonomic backbone over the next twelve to eighteen months and resolve issues that have not already addressed.</p>



<p>We are continuing to provide both NSL and NZOR names for plant species, at the request of the <a href="https://chah.gov.au/">Council of Australasian Herbaria</a>.&nbsp;There will continue to be some duplication both in the taxonomic tree and in scientific name synonyms between Australia and New Zealand. For fungi, protists (including algae), bacteria and viruses, we will continue accepting names from NSL, NZOR and CoL.</p>
