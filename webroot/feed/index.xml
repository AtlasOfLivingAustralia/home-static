<p><strong>Meet our 2022 Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program winners</strong></p>



<p>As Australia is home to unique biodiversity and ecosystems, it’s vital that researchers, governments and industry have access to high-quality data so they can better understand, monitor and protect species.</p>



<p>While biodiversity data such as physical specimens in collections, or data from field programs are used to address specific research goals, these data often require additional resources to ensure they can be digitised and made available nationally as open data.</p>



<p>To improve data accessibility the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) launched the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/the-ala-australian-biodiversity-data-mobilisation-program/">Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program</a>. This program is designed to support Australian museums, biological collections, herbaria, and research teams to digitise their data, and making it available through the ALA, and internationally through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).</p>



<p>Through a nationally competitive application process, six projects were awarded grants to digitise their priority biodiversity data. The output from this program will enable data on rare and unique species to become open and accessible through the ALA. Using FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable), this data will support research, decision making and conservation efforts to better protect Australian biodiversity.</p>

<p><strong>The successful projects:</strong></p>



<p>In the 2022 round of the program, applicants were able to apply for either a small grant of $20,000 or a large grant of $50,000 to support activities to digitise existing biodiversity data. Four small grants and two large grants were awarded in 2022 with data from these projects expected to be made available through the ALA by July 2023.</p>



<p>The successful 2022 projects include the following:</p>



<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, NSW – mobilising plant pest and disease data from the NSW Biosecurity Collections (~600,000 records).</li>



<li>South Australia Museum (SAM), SA– mobilise the SAM’s Australian Biological Tissues Collection of 39 donated frozen tissue collections of Australian freshwater fishes (around 90% of all known species and ~46,000 records).</li>



<li>Queensland Museum Network, QLD – mobilising and enhance data from the Cribb Australian Fish Trematode Collection (&gt;20,000 records of &gt;1,000 fish species).</li>



<li>Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, TAS – mobilising wildlife molecular and tissue data (&gt; 8,500 sample vials and 1,650 formalin fixed specimens in the histology collection).</li>



<li>Edith Cowan University, WA – mobilising plant and fungi data from the Robert Brown Herbarium.</li>



<li>Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, WA – mobilising data in the Kings Park and Botanic Garden Herbarium collection (18,200 specimens).</li>
</ol>



<p>Congratulations to the successful projects, we look forward to working with them to make their data available nationally. We’d like to also acknowledge the applications that were not successful as they were universally excellent making our assessment process very challenging. We are also grateful to the independent review panel chaired by Professor David Cantrill for their work in reviewing proposals and selecting a fantastic suite of final recipients.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/#tab_pane-B">Atlas of Living Australia</a> was delighted to host three undergraduate students from the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/">University of New South Wales</a> (UNSW) as part of a 12-week internship program across spring – summer 2022. Our interns were spread across two streams: a Data Science Internship, which offered students the opportunity to apply their Python or R skills to biodiversity problem solving, and a Data Visualisation for Communication Internship, which used ALA’s R package, <a href="https://galah.ala.org.au/">{galah}</a>, to create visualisations that are reproducible and scientifically transparent.</p>



<p>We chatted with our students, Steph, Elijah and Thai, to find out more about their ALA internship experience and what they’ve learned throughout the process.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Steph-Wooley-2022-ALA-intern-300x290.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-47730" width="370" height="361"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steph Woolley &#8211; Data Visualisation intern</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong><u>Steph is studying a Bachelor of Advanced Science majoring in Marine &amp; Coastal Science.</u></strong></p>



<p>Q) What made you apply for the 2022 ALA Internship program?</p>



<p><em>A) Throughout my studies, I had always seen these amazing ways of displaying data and communicating science. When this internship appeared through an email by UNSW, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to develop my skills and to try to create one of the visualisations I had always seen in my courses.</em></p>



<p>Q) What did your ALA internship project focus on?</p>



<p><em>A) My internship was a data visualisation and analysis project. I spent my time analysing ALA data and developing a visualisation from the data that I had chosen to look at.</em></p>



<p>Q) What was a new skill you learned through the program that you’re proud of?</p>



<p>A)&nbsp;<em>I’m most proud of how my coding skills have developed over the internship. When I look back to the knowledge I had when I started this internship compared to what I have now, there’s a really big difference. I’m proud of how much I’ve learnt and the skills I’ve been able to build upon over the last 12 weeks.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q) What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?</p>



<p>A)&nbsp;<em>The biggest challenge for me across the 12 weeks has been time management and trusting the process. Throughout my university experience, I haven’t really had any experiences like this where we are working towards one main goal for such a long period of time. I think the process of making little steps each week towards the main goal has been a really big learning experience and it was definitely a challenge to get used to trying to achieve smaller tasks on a weekly basis rather than a larger main goal.</em></p>



<p>Q) What was your highlight from the internship program?</p>



<p>A)&nbsp;<em>The main highlight of the internship program was having the opportunity to develop my coding skills and being able and develop this skill with help and feedback from my supervisor. Having the opportunity to spend a long period of time working on a project that you have come up with, and that you find interesting, was also a big highlight.</em></p>



<p><em>The best individual moment though was definitely the day I finally got my visualisation and model to work and I could see the project coming together!</em></p>

<p><strong><u>Elijah is studying a Bachelor of Advanced Science majoring in Ecology</u></strong></p>



<p>Q) What made you apply for the 2022 ALA Internship program?</p>



<p>A)&nbsp;<em> I had wanted to do an internship position before I started my honours project in February and thought it was a great opportunity to gain real-world experience and further develop my skills in data science.</em></p>



<p>Q) What did your ALA internship project focus on?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>A) My internship focused on standardising expert distribution maps. These are maps that represent where species can be found in Australia. These datasets are sent through to the ALA in different formats and layouts which need to be managed. My task was to convert all of the datasets into the format of existing expert distribution maps in the ALA and upload them so everyone can see the new maps.</em></p>



<p>Q) What was a new skill you learned through the program that you’re proud of?</p>



<p><em>A) I am proud to say that I can now program in Python! I have attempted to learn Python prior to the internship but having a project to work on makes motivation much easier. I am very pleased to have learned this skill as it helps broaden my study and career choices in the future.</em></p>



<p>Q) What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?</p>



<p><em>A) Learning how to manage my time properly was definitely my biggest challenge. I hadn’t realised how exhausting it was to balance study, work, and learning Python. However, creating a structured routine has helped significantly with managing my time. It was great to have this opportunity to further develop time-management skills ahead of my honours project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Q) What was your highlight of the internship program?</p>



<p><em>A) The highlight of my internship program was seeing the maps load properly on the test server. Initially, I had many issues that had caused the maps I uploaded to not show up. Once I had figured out what I had done wrong, fixed the issues, and tried uploading again, I felt very relieved to see that the maps were loading properly. After the issues were ironed out, the rest of the datasets were straight-forward.</em></p>

<p><strong><u>Thai is studying a Bachelor of Fine Arts and Science majoring in Photography &amp; Ecology.</u></strong></p>



<p>Q) What made you apply for the 2022 ALA Internship program?</p>



<p>A)<em>&nbsp;My university posted a list of internship positions available, and the ALA was on there! I’d heard of the ALA before and thought the data analysis/visualization combination suited my interests really well.</em></p>



<p>Q) What did your ALA internship project focus on?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A<em>) My project focused on the number of ducks recorded in greater Melbourne in the COVID-19 lockdown periods of 2020-2021. I was comparing them to ‘normal’ years, 2017-2019, to see if there was any difference.</em></p>



<p>Q) What was a new skill you learned through the program that you’re proud of?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A)&nbsp;<em>I started the term with very basic R-Studio skills, so I learnt a lot about R by organising data, transforming it, and creating the actual visualisations. I think I learnt more R-Studio tricks in this one term than the rest of my degree to date!</em></p>



<p>Q) What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A)<em> Initially I was so nervous I didn’t have the skills needed to make a great project, so it took me a while to get started. Once I gained a little confidence, I was able to get creative and I’m very happy with the results.</em></p>



<p>Q) What was your highlight of the internship program?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A<em>) Coming together with the other interns at the end of the term to see what they had been working on was amazing. I loved seeing the different paths we took given a similar brief.</em></p>

<p>In this issue, we are pleased to present you with our Year in Review for 2021-22. Our Year in Review showcases ALA’s highlights, and reflects on the fundamental contribution made by our partners in supporting our mission. 2021-22 was an important year for the ALA, highlighted by some innovative new capability releases including <a href="https://labs.ala.org.au/">ALA Labs</a>, our work with partner NCRIS facilities to establish and launch <a href="https://ecoassets.org.au/">EcoAssets</a>, and the inaugural launch of the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/abdmp/">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program</a>. Last year was also a time of significant team growth for the ALA and we now have staff in six  capital cities working with our partners, our projects and supporting our applications and systems. Having a national team has been a welcome by-product of some of the constraints imposed upon us over the past few years. Finally, doing justice to the breadth of research we enable in any year is always a challenge, but we’ve showcased four stellar examples of how a national biodiversity data infrastructure enables Australian science. We hope you enjoy reading our 2021-22 story as much as we’ve enjoyed building it.</p>



<p>I was recently privileged to represent the Australian delegation at the Governing Board meeting of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) held for the first time in person in three years in Brussels, but also supporting a hybrid model. It was a great opportunity to connect with people we only ever see virtually. It&#8217;s nice to see the shared challenges, understand where our partners are heading strategically and benchmark ALA’s approach both technically and strategically. The global context is different to ours but nevertheless, we run a federated data infrastructure built on strong relationships across many sectors, so we learn so much at these events. An additional highlight for me was attending a one-day symposium hosted by GBIF and the European Biodiversa+ program called Data Beyond Borders that explored the role data infrastructure can play in supporting major national research and policy programs. This is clearly one of the next frontiers for capabilities such as ALA, and our partners in the NCRIS program.</p>



<p>The GBIF experience has affirmed the importance of ALA’s international role, and the opportunities this affords moving forward. Our delegation concluded the meeting with a successful nomination to host the 2023 Governing Board Meeting in Canberra – it’s been almost 20 years since Australia played this role and we are excited to welcome our international partners in 2023.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been some years since we’ve all travelled and engaged in person, but our team have been re-energised by this year’s conference season. This has included our recent participation in eResearch Australasia in Brisbane, remote participation in the TDWG international meeting, GBIF in Europe, and in-person participation at the Ecological Society of Australia conference in Wollongong in November. I’d like to conclude by acknowledging the groups and individuals that do such an amazing job designing, coordinating, and running conferences to support our sector.&nbsp; We appreciate the work you do! We hope you enjoy our November edition.</p>

<p>We’ve just released a new API gateway to access our APIs: <a href="https://docs.ala.org.au/">docs.ala.org.au</a>! Over 130 API endpoints have been migrated across to Swagger in a beta release, and we’re working on making more available very soon.</p>



<p>ALA is passionate about empowering and supporting great research, so we’ve released APIs which were only used internally in the past. You can now use these in your work to access our open-source data more easily and feed into downstream analyses using your own system. We can’t wait for you to try them out and let us know what you think!</p>

<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 id="what-about-security"><strong>What about security?</strong></h4>



<p>The new portal will increase security for both ALA and you, our user. By moving to JSON Web Tokens (JWT), we’re able to open up access to previously unreleased APIs.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 id="jwt-tokens-but-isnt-ala-providing-access-to-open-data"><strong>JWT tokens? But isn’t ALA providing access to open data?</strong></h4>



<p>Yes, we still are! (And we’re still free to use too).</p>



<p>Most of our APIs&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;require authentication and can be accessed freely as documented in the relevant Swagger specifications found at&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.ala.org.au/">docs.ala.org.au</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the protected APIs (such as sensitive or private data), you’ll need a&nbsp;JWT, which can be generated via a Client ID and Client Secret&nbsp;– let us know if you require this and we can assist.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 id="whats-happening-to-the-existing-api-portal"><strong>What’s happening to the existing API portal?</strong></h4>

<p>Does it croak or growl, have fangs or howl? Does it scream at night or give you a fright? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f383.png" alt="🎃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Many iconic living (or dead) things that are seen around Halloween are inspired by species in the natural world! Check out some of the most spook-tacular Aussie species!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1009" height="541" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-47481" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC.jpg 1009w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px" /><figcaption>Goblin Shark (<em>Mitsukurina owstoni</em>) Museums Victoria CC BY NC</figcaption></figure>

<p>Talk about a creature from nightmares, the Goblin Shark is one of the most illusive deep-sea sharks known to scientists with a distinctive blade-like snout and pink skin. Specimens have been found along continental slopes at distances up to 1.3 km deep, measuring 3-4 metres in length. The Goblin Shark has distinctive mouthparts, specialised for rapid projection as their jaws can extend and retract to catch prey.</p>



<p>They are the only extant member of the&nbsp;<em>Mitsukurina</em>&nbsp;genus, often called a ‘living fossil’ as this genus traces back 125 million years. These sharks are incredibly illusive, with limited specimens recorded around NSW, Victoria and Tasmania in Australia, as well as Portugal and Japan. Not much is known about the reproductive life cycle of this species as a pregnant Goblin Shark has never been recorded.</p>

<p>If the pumpkin-orange colour doesn’t scare you off, maybe its stench will! This stinkbug produces a rotten-smelling spray from the chemical ‘cimicine.’ This spray doesn’t just pack a pungent punch, its main function is to be a defensive mechanism against predators – most commonly other arthropods and birds – which can be lethal to these species. To humans, the spray can cause significant irritation. This is a classic case of ‘look but don’t touch’, no matter your species!</p>



<p>As eggs and nymphs, Bronze Orange Bugs are green in colour but as they mature through their five instar stages of development, they acquire their distinctive orange colour to resemble citrus leaves. They are considered pests in commercial citrus orchards across eastern Australia.</p>

<p>It’s not just it’s physical appearance that’s scary, this plant’s impact on biosecurity is equally terrifying.</p>



<p>Also known as the ‘cemetery flower’ or ‘common thorn apple’, this plant is one of the most invasive noxious weeds around the world, including in Australia. It has been known to poison humans and animals, reduce pasture productivity and compete with native flora.</p>



<p>A member of the nightshade family, Jimsonweed was originally introduced in Australia in the 1800s for medicinal and ornamental purposes. The most toxic part of the plant are its black seeds which disperse through water, contaminated hay and mud stuck to vehicles.&nbsp;The spiny seed capsule is as aggressive as it looks and will injure those who dare to touch…</p>

<p>Australia is home to more than 90 species of bats including both mega bats and micro bats. Although some bat species around the world do feed on blood (and are most likely the inspiration for Halloween stories), the Spectacled Flying Fox is more likely bring you joy rather than terror!</p>



<p>These endangered fruit bats live in the northern tropics and feed on native fruits, flowers, and myrtle plants. They play a pivotal role in rainforest ecosystems as seed dispersers and pollinators. Aptly named, the Spectacled Flying Fox has light yellow fur around its eyes and snout giving the appearance that its wearing glasses. They typically live to be around 12 -15 years old in the wild but have been known to live up to 30 years old in captivity.</p>

<p>A shriek in the night, a blood curdling scream, you investigate the source only to find…a Far Eastern Curlew?</p>



<p>Known for making exceptionally long migratory travels to breed between northern and southern hemispheres, Far Eastern Curlews are also iconic for their scream-like vocalisation calls.&nbsp;They use their hauntingly beautiful calls as part of mating displays and to assert dominance over their territory.</p>



<p>With a long scimitar-shaped beak which can be more than 50% the length of their body and dark-streaked plumage, the Far Eastern Curlew is the largest shorebird in the world. This species is reliant on mudflats and mangrove swamps for feeding and breeding. Unfortunately, this species is listed as ‘endangered’ due to loss of habitat, causing population decline across their ranges.</p>

<p>Hairy, spotty and slime green! Could this spider be the ultimate creature for Halloween?</p>



<p>Orbweaver spiders are common across Australia, known for making intricate, sticky webs at night to catch prey. Orbweavers occupy crevices and leaves during the day, and if they feel significantly threatened, they will drop to the ground and ‘play dead.’</p>



<p>The Speckled Orbweaver prefers to occupy green foliage, to blend in with the surroundings. As with many spider species, females are larger than males at approximately 6mm in length, with males 3mm in length.</p>

<p><strong><u><a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https:/id.biodiversity.org.au/node/fungi/60094367">Ghost Fungus <em>(Omphalotus nidiformis</em></a></u></strong>)</p>



<p>Like something out of a fairy-tale, Ghost Fungi glow through their gills with a green-tinged light. They emit ‘cold light’ where less than 20% of light emitted is capable of radiating heat. Ghost Fungi, and other bioluminescent creatures, fluoresce using a compound called ‘luciferin’. They grow on dead or decaying wood and are commonly found across Australia in temperate areas. The exact reason this species uses bioluminescence is not known, however a theory is that by glowing the fungi attracts insects which disperse its spores.</p>



<p>Ghost Fungi are poisonous if consumed, however are often mistaken for Oyster Mushrooms due to their similar fan-like appearance and milky-white colouration in the daytime.</p>
