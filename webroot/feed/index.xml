<p>We have just released <em>galah</em>, our new software package for accessing ALA data. This makes it easier than ever to find, download and analyse information on Australian biodiversity.</p>



<p>We created <em>galah </em>to support users who need to access ALA data in bulk. Many researchers routinely use programming languages to request data, rather than manually navigating our website. For the biodiversity research community, the most commonly used programming language is called ‘R’.</p>



<p>R is a useful programming language by itself; but it’s most valuable feature is the ability to write and share bundles of software – called ‘packages’ – which users can install to achieve specific tasks.</p>



<p><em>galah</em> enables ALA users to locate and download occurrence records, taxonomic information, and associated media such as images or sounds. It allows users to directly integrate data from the ALA into their analyses in R.</p>



<h4 id="naming-ala4rs-successor">Naming ALA4R&#8217;s successor</h4>



<p>We chose to call our new software ‘galah’ for a few reasons. First, it is an iconic Australian species that many people will be familiar with. Second, the word galah already contains the acronym ‘ALA’. Finally, a poll of users on social media chose <em>galah</em> over other options.</p>



<p>This package is the successor to the earlier <em>ALA4R</em>, which has been available for R users since 2014. <em>galah </em>provides an improved and simplified user experience to <em>ALA4R</em>, while still providing the same core functionality. <em>ALA4R </em>will be maintained but not actively developed while users transition to <em>galah</em>, and we encourage users to make the switch as soon as practical.</p>

<h4 id="early-adoption-and-recent-updates">Early adoption and recent updates</h4>



<p>Since we developed <em>galah</em>, early adopters have been testing the package extensively in classes and research projects around the country. The team recently presented <em>galah </em>at a Software Carpentry workshop on ‘R for ecologists’, where participants learnt how to use the package to download data to use in their ecological research. Internally, the ALA’s Science and Decision Support team are already using the package in their day-to-day work and on projects such as <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/ecoassets/">EcoAssets</a>.</p>



<p>As part of the latest update to <em>galah</em>, released this week, support for international Living Atlases has been introduced. This enables users from countries including Austria, Guatemala and Spain to use <em>galah</em> to download and analyse data from their country.</p>

<p></p>



<p>On the coldest day in Sydney in 25 years, I was thrilled to attend the launch of the <a href="https://www.ps.org.au/bb-highway-about">B&amp;B Highway’s</a> citizen science component of their program. The B&amp;B Highway Program –  spearheaded by Dr Judy Friedlander of <a href="https://www.ps.org.au/">PlantingSeeds Projects</a>, aims to provide habitat for birds, bees, butterflies and biodiversity through native plantings and the installation of pollinator habitats such as native stingless beehives, nesting boxes and insect hotels. The program is now in more than 50 schools and community locations throughout NSW and is making inroads in other states throughout Australia.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="842" height="399" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/07/BB-highway_1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44821" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/07/BB-highway_1.jpg 842w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/07/BB-highway_1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/07/BB-highway_1-768x364.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px" /><figcaption><em>Schools learn more about pollinators and habitat through participation in the B&amp;B Highway Program which also offers indoor and outdoor, and theoretical and practical teachings about biodiversity.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The June launch celebrated the partnership of CSIRO’s Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), the Australian Citizen Science Association (ACSA) and the B&amp;B Highway in enabling citizen science data to flow from the program into the ALA. The aim for the program is to contribute valuable pollinator and plant data so the data is freely available for anyone to use. The program has been set up on <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/b-b-highway-nsw">iNaturalist</a> so that all participating schools can see their observations under the umbrella B&amp;B Highway Project.</p>



<p>Despite the chill, the launch kicked off with a search of the garden at Ryde East Public School, where a number of young pollinator enthusiasts from different schools had been assembled. While we didn’t find many pollinators, it showed the importance of seasonal sampling for true indication of pollinator diversity. Speeches, snacks and celebrations then followed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Emus are iconic. They join Kangaroos on the Australian coat of arms and are an essential part of any visit to the outback. They are also among the last of the Australia’s giant animals, or megafauna, giving us a window on Australia’s past giants. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/Emu-by-Julia-Ryeland-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44778" width="521" height="346" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/Emu-by-Julia-Ryeland-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/Emu-by-Julia-Ryeland-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/Emu-by-Julia-Ryeland.jpg 1090w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><figcaption>In a recent study by Julia Ryeland from Western Sydney University explored how Emus (<em>Dromaius novaehollandia)</em> have adapted to environmental changes in Australia.<em> </em> (c) Julia Ryeland.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The emu is a member of a unique, ancient group of birds known as ‘ratites’ – flightless but widely distributed, spanning all southern hemisphere continents. This group includes species such as the ostrich, rhea, kiwi, cassowary and tinamou. The ratites are one of the most pre-historic groups of birds, in part because they are highly adaptable.</p>



<p>Emus have persisted in Australia through thousands of years; but anecdotal evidence suggests they are less common than they used to be. Increasing urbanisation and the removal of emus from farming lands means this species isn’t as widespread as it once was.</p>



<p>With populations condensing we begin to ask where will be the safe haven for emus in the future? It turns out answering this simple question is harder than you’d think.</p>



<p>Every species has an area across which it can be found – a ‘geographic distribution’. Knowing exactly where this is helps us develop an understanding of the species, how it may adapt over time, and assist in decision making about conservation. For example, if a species only lives in a small area, it may be of larger concern compared to species that can be found all over the country, across a wide range of habitats and climates.</p>



<p>Australia’s climate has changed over many thousands of years, and the species that live here have moved with it. The country has been subject to long periods where it was wetter or drier, and where sea levels were lower or higher. This begged a series of questions &#8211; how have emus adapted to these changes, being one of the most pre-historic species? What effect have these changes had on where emus can live? How will this change with further human impact on the environment?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/Emu-study-figure-4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44779" width="495" height="368" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/Emu-study-figure-4.jpg 657w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/Emu-study-figure-4-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /><figcaption>Predicted distribution change from ensemble models, across Australia and the Great Dividing Range region, past to present and present to future. The figures were generated in R (version 3.6.0, <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</a>).</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To answer these questions, we turned to a method called ‘species distribution modelling’ (SDM). SDMs take maps of where an animal has been seen and combines them with information about the environment at these locations, such as the climate (temperature and rainfall) and habitat (e.g. vegetation available and land uses). These combine to make a ‘prediction map’ of where a species can be found. The more sightings of a species there are, the more accurate these maps are likely to be.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Emus are one of the most easily identified species and people love taking pictures of them! In fact, citizen scientists routinely record between 5,000 and 30,000 emu sightings every year across Australia. These sightings are collected and stored in a single place –the Atlas of Living Australia (<a href="https://www.ala.org.au">https://www.ala.org.au</a>). Here, they can be freely viewed and downloaded by anyone.</p>



<p>With these data, we built a model that shows the climate and habitat that emus prefer today; where suitable climate was 6,000 years ago; and where it will be in 50 years’ time.</p>



<p>We found that in the past 6,000 years, emus have made vast shifts inland across central Australia. These shifts have been driven mostly by climate, with emus minimally influenced by environmental factors such as habitat type, distance from water, land use types or fire frequency. These changes have greatly expanded the emu’s range and are predicted to remain stable over the next 50 years.</p>



<p>At the same time, however, emus have progressively been lost from the east coast. Now on the edge of their climatically suitable range, east coast emus are likely to be more susceptible to other threats, such as poor reproductive success due to predation by feral animals on the eggs and chicks.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/emu-camera-trap-image-1024x574.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44780" width="444" height="250" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/emu-camera-trap-image-1024x574.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/emu-camera-trap-image-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/emu-camera-trap-image-768x430.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/06/emu-camera-trap-image.jpg 1099w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /><figcaption>Camera trap image of emu feeding from an east coast population. Image credit: Julia Ryeland</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Emu disappearance across the east coast is unlikely to make the species vulnerable to the threat of extinction, because of the stability of their overall expansive range. However, the local extinction of emu populations across the east coast could have ecosystem wide implications.</p>



<p>Emus can travel up to 100km a year and move the seeds of native plants huge distances with them as they go. Without emus, many plant species will find it harder to disperse to new habitats or share genetic material between isolated plant communities. Combined with other threats such as habitat loss and predation by introduced species, our east coast plant communities could soon be in trouble.</p>



<p>Just as poignant, though, is the importance of emus in Australian culture, both in European and Indigenous histories. The emu is a totem to many indigenous groups and is shown on the Australian coat of arms.</p>



<p>Across the east coast where urbanisation is progressing rapidly, encountering a species such as the emu gives many Australian’s an important connection to nature that can help inspire conservation efforts for our lesser known, declining fauna.</p>

<ul><li>an extension&nbsp;to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-upgrade-on-its-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Infrastructure Upgrade&nbsp;Project</a>&nbsp;working&nbsp;with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;a strategic shift to support more complex biodiversity data&nbsp;</li><li>our&nbsp;three&nbsp;Australian Research Data Commons&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;projects&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/ecoassets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EcoAssets</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/improving-access-to-sensitive-species-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sensitive Species Data Pathways</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ardc.edu.au/project/ecocommons-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EcoCommons&nbsp;Australia</a>, and&nbsp;</li><li>more tactical activities such as an uplift&nbsp;of&nbsp;the ALA’s&nbsp;R software&nbsp;suite&nbsp;and enhancements to our Biodiversity Information Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The ALA has historically focussed on harmonising Australia’s biodiversity data pertaining to native plants and animals, and providing related data products and services to our key users across research, government, industry and community. However, we are increasingly seeing the value of our infrastructure in supporting biosecurity-related applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this issue we highlight our partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment’s Chief Environmental Biosecurity Office, which has been able to leverage a decade of ALA data partnerships and robust infrastructure to support the development of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-helps-to-stop-pests-in-their-tracks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novel biosecurity alert capability</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a pressing need for an improved national approach for dealing with biosecurity data.&nbsp;I was reminded of this earlier this week with the Government’s release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/threatened-species-strategy-2021-2031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Threatened Species Strategy</a>&nbsp;where again we see the importance of understanding the distribution of invasive species, and the importance of&nbsp; knowledge and tools in supporting our mitigation programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a world of citizen science apps, biosecurity-related research programs,&nbsp;and government programs capturing data pertaining to species of biosecurity concern. Harmonising these data&nbsp;into a national data infrastructure will become an increasingly strategically important part of ALA’s work program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also been a tremendous few months with respect to team growth. We’ve welcomed two new data analysts to the ALA, working under Dr Martin Westgate, and in coming weeks we’ll welcome an R-developer to work alongside our partner EcoCommons program. </p>



<p>Our uplift in data analytics capability will provide improved ALA data support to external stakeholders, projects and partners. The new team members will complement our existing data management team responsible for liaising with our data partners to bring data into the ALA. They will provide customised data services to our partners and support the next partnership opportunity that arises.  </p>



<p>I hope you enjoy the May&nbsp;2021&nbsp;edition of our&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) team has been busy working on our Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project to improve our systems and make them more robust and more efficient.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="288" height="279" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/AcroRd32_2020-02-05_14-56-31.png" alt="ALA Infrastructure Upgrade Project icon" class="wp-image-43653"/></figure></div>



<p>The&nbsp;upgraded code base&nbsp;will replace the&nbsp;ALA’s&nbsp;species&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;record&nbsp;ingestion&nbsp;systems&nbsp;and&nbsp;will be released soon&nbsp;(late&nbsp;June-July 2021).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the work is happening behind the scenes, so hopefully&nbsp;you&nbsp;won’t&nbsp;notice&nbsp;any significant changes to your everyday use of the ALA.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you&nbsp;do&nbsp;see&nbsp;anything out of the&nbsp;ordinary&nbsp;please let us know on&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support@ala.org.au</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is just&nbsp;the first&nbsp;stage of our&nbsp;three stage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/current-projects/core-infrastructure-upgrade-project/">Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The&nbsp;</strong><strong>Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project</strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong>our</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>focus</strong><strong>&nbsp;for 2020-22</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project is a major&nbsp;project&nbsp;on our ALA Work Plan&nbsp;2020-21 and&nbsp;will continue into the coming year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project&nbsp;team&nbsp;has rewritten&nbsp;various components of the ALA&nbsp;species&nbsp;occurrence record&nbsp;ingestion&nbsp;system&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&nbsp;now shares a common code base with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Global Biodiversity Information Facility&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;plus&nbsp;some adjustments&nbsp;for the ALA’s specific requirements. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The new infrastructure will be&nbsp;fit-for-purpose, more maintainable and able to adapt to our future needs as Australia’s national biodiversity&nbsp;data infrastructure.&nbsp;These&nbsp;improvements will enable the ALA to manage increases in data volume and different types&nbsp;of data. ​ &nbsp;</p>



<p>The upgrade will also mean&nbsp;we&#8217;re&nbsp;better positioned to handle data load automation.&nbsp;Our data partners will be empowered to control the currency and quality of their data. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why are we upgrading ALA’s core infrastructure?  </strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>After 10 years of active development, the ALA’s core data processing infrastructure is approaching ‘end of life’. The Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project will enable the ALA to adapt to changing data and user requirements heading into our next decade of operation. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Getting ready for more data and more complex data</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are already seeing large volumes of new generation occurrence records coming from automated observations such as camera trapping, bioacoustics, animal tracking, and genetics including eDNA.&nbsp;Our current infrastructure is at&nbsp;capacity&nbsp;accommodating our&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;record volume of just under 100m records.&nbsp;We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;handle much larger data volumes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GBIF&nbsp;already&nbsp;manages 1.7 billion occurrence records and sees exponential year-on-year growth.&nbsp;By collaborating with GBIF, we&nbsp;greatly&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from their experience with large data volumes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new infrastructure will also enable us to join GBIF in adopting newer data types and other TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards) extensions. It will open up opportunities to collaborate on new initiatives with GBIF’s development team and the international biodiversity data community. </p>



<p><strong>Partnering with&nbsp;</strong><strong>GBIF</strong><strong>&nbsp;and the international Living Atlases</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout the&nbsp;Core Infrastructure Upgrade&nbsp;Project,&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;been&nbsp;working closely with GBIF&nbsp;and collaborating on&nbsp;a&nbsp;shared codebase. We’re&nbsp;also&nbsp;communicating&nbsp;with our user and stakeholder communities and the <a href="https://living-atlases.gbif.org/">international Living Atlases community. </a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Living Atlases is an international&nbsp;community of 26 biodiversity data infrastructures originally built on the&nbsp;ALA code base.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is a vibrant development community,&nbsp;sharing and&nbsp;contributing to a common code base. Most of the&nbsp;Living Atlas instances&nbsp;are nodes of GBIF&nbsp;and as such&nbsp;are stakeholders in the future of the infrastructure&nbsp;upgrade&nbsp;work. Throughout the project, the GBIF and ALA development teams have&nbsp;been&nbsp;keeping&nbsp;the&nbsp;Living Atlases community&nbsp;up-to-date and&nbsp;abreast&nbsp;of the changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Atlas of Living Australia and its large network of biodiversity data providers are helping our national
Environmental Biosecurity Office  (EBO) in the Department of  Agriculture, Water and the  Environment (DAWE) to protect  Australia’s flora and fauna from  exotic biosecurity threats. ]]></description>

<h3 id="ala-biosecurity-alert-system">ALA biosecurity alert system</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/21280-ALA-Case-Study-Fact-Sheets-Biosecurity-V3-lowres.pdf"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Biosecurity-thumbnail.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44709" width="333" height="471" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Biosecurity-thumbnail.png 642w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Biosecurity-thumbnail-212x300.png 212w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/21280-ALA-Case-Study-Fact-Sheets-Biosecurity-V3-lowres.pdf">View or print this impact story as a PDF</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Keeping track of environmental pests and weeds is an ongoing challenge. Government biosecurity efforts aim to prevent, respond to and assist recovery from pests and diseases, with particular focus on the invasive species that threaten our environment and the economy. Early detection of exotic and introduced pest species is crucial to managing and eradicating invasive pests. </p>



<p>The EBO is charged with protecting Australia’s native flora, fauna and associated social amenity from the damaging effects of exotic pests, weeds and diseases that come  from overseas. One of their biggest challenges is knowing when pests and diseases first come into Australia and keeping track of their spread across the country. International border controls and quarantine measures are crucial elements for biosecurity control, but pests, weeds and diseases can still elude these controls. </p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) harnesses innovative solutions to complement existing methods of detection to further bolster biosecurity incursion surveillance. </p>



<p>For over ten years, the ALA – our national biodiversity data infrastructure – has been aggregating occurrence records of plant, animals and fungi species from over 700 data partners. In 2020, the ALA worked closely with DAWE to establish automatic alerts for targeted species on the National Priority List of Exotic Environmental Pests, Weeds and Diseases that are considered the greatest biosecurity risks to Australia. Using this list, the ALA set up an alert system. Now, when observations of those target species are uploaded to the database, an alert is sent to the EBO.</p>

Image credit: This image was taken in the USA and uploaded to iNaturalist by Chris Alice Kratzer (CC-BY-SA)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The value of the alert system has already been demonstrated regarding incursion reports in Victoria. In early 2020, a suspected sighting of the Asian shore crab by a member of the public on Port Phillip Bay in Victoria. This sighting was uploaded as a report into the ALA and provided the earliest available alert of the incursions. Early awareness of incursions into Australia by exotic species such as the Asian shore crab provide the best scenario for implementing successful management and eradication programs. If left unchecked exotic species can spread rapidly and compete with our native flora and fauna. </p>



<p>This episode demonstrated that the ALA notification system can provide over 9 months earlier warning of an incursion. Another example of the benefits of the ALA notification system, involving an exotic wasp, demonstrated that an incursion could be found 24-36 months earlier than the current reporting system. The notification system can also include a facility to validate and amend reports, which can be important for clarifying Australia’s pest status. Citizen science apps such as iNaturalist Australia, among many others, feed data into the ALA and directly contribute to the national biosecurity surveillance system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <em>“The ALA alert system is simple and is proving to be an important asset to our operational capability,” </em>said Andrew Pearce, from DAWE’s Environmental Biosecurity Office<em>. </em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“This is a layer of defence we haven’t had before and it has excellent potential for further development and expansion to deliver a low cost biosecurity surveillance and monitoring capability</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>The national biosecurity alert system is an excellent example of how the ALA is able to provide trusted biodiversity data to support environmental biosecurity program managers and help deliver better outcomes for Australian ecosystems and environments.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’re pleased to announce Professor Stephen van Leeuwen has been appointed to our Advisory Board and look forward to him joining our next meeting in July 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1024x731.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44704" width="380" height="270" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1536x1096.jpg 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1920x1370.jpg 1920w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/05/SvL-WestPix_low-res.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></figure></div>



<p>Professor Stephen van Leeuwen is a respected South West Boojarah Wardandi Noongar man whose Country is in the Busselton &#8211; Margaret River area of south west Western Australia.  He is a botanical ecologist, with a diverse research pedigree extending from threatened flora survey, fire ecology and threatened flora and fauna management through to biological survey, arid zone ecology, plant taxonomy and pollination biology.</p>



<p>As a botanical ecologist Stephen has had a long career working with biological data, from early work experience projects at the WA Herbarium, to being involved in the foundational WA Orchid Atlas and Banksia Atlas projects. He has also undertaken and managed botanical and biological surveys across the Pilbara, Gascoyne and neighbouring Western Deserts including fulfilling a leadership role in the Pilbara Biological Survey.</p>



<p>Prior to leaving the WA Public Service, Stephen was Assistant Director of Science in the Biodiversity and Conservation portfolio at the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, overseeing operations of the WA Herbarium and of the Western Australian biodiversity data portal &#8211; NatureMap. He also collaborated with the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute (WABSI) to establish the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/newsletter/ala-helps-improve-environmental-impact-assessments-in-western-australia/">Index of Biodiversity Surveys for Assessments</a> (IBSA) program and was also the WA champion for the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network’s (TERN) Surveillance (formerly AusPlots and Australian Transect Network) program.</p>



<p><strong>Building cultural competency and engagement with Indigenous Australians</strong></p>



<p>In a recent chat, Stephen shared with us his vision for his role with the ALA.</p>



<p>“I’m very keen to guide the ALA as it builds capacity and capabilities to be a culturally safe organisation that can respectfully capture, curate and support Traditional Knowledge (including language) and all it entails while ensuring the sovereignty of this knowledge, Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights and the mutual sharing of benefit derived from such knowledge,” Stephen said.</p>



<p>“I hope to build the Board’s cultural competency and engagement with Indigenous Australians to address the needs and aspirations of Indigenous Australians.&nbsp; In part I’ll do this by unlocking opportunities within my networks across Indigenous, academic, government and corporate sectors to build collaborations and minimise duplication of effort with respect to the participation and engagement of Indigenous Australians in the operations and activities of ALA.”</p>



<p><strong>Making a mark: some key priorities for his tenure with the ALA</strong></p>



<p>From a pragmatic on-ground perspective Stephen would like to see ALA’s activities continue to grow and service the needs of Indigenous land and sea Country managers and ranger teams, particularly in respect to the development of tools and applications that enable greater Traditional Knowledge capture, a reduction in the duplication of effort, and a greater emphasis on how Traditional Knowledge can help provide solutions to biodiversity conservation and land management challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While on the ALA Board, Stephen would like to ensure that the ALA becomes a culturally safe organisation which has a governance framework that supports Indigenous Australians and respectfully engages with them to capture Traditional Knowledge, including language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m keen to ensure that data is appropriately managed in terms of Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights, and that sovereignty of the data remains with the Knowledge holder,” he said.</p>



<p>“I am also keen to ensure that language is captured as part of Traditional Knowledge, as language is inherently linked to culture, and Country for Indigenous Australians.”</p>



<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>



<p>When not working Stephen enjoys botanising, fishing, pottering around the house and in his workshop and keeping abreast of Australian ecological literature.</p>



<p>Stephen attended Christian Brother College in Perth for his high school education.  He was a reasonable cross country and mid-distance runner and sprinter.  His finishing time for the 400m sprint at the Inter-school Catholic Colleges sports carnival set in 1985 still stands!</p>

<p>The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/collection/bhlau">biodiversitylibrary.org</a>) is the world’s largest online library of biodiversity literature and archival materials. The project is a global consortium of 523 contributing libraries who have together digitised over 59 million pages of the world’s biodiversity literature, all of which is freely accessible online, for everyone. </p>



<p>BHL Australia joined the global consortium in 2010.</p>

<p>The BHL Australia project was one of the very first collaborative projects established by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/"> ala.org.au</a>). It is funded and operates as a co-investment between Museums Victoria and the ALA. </p>



<p>BHL Australia now supports 37 contributing organisations from every state and territory across the country. These include Australia’s state museums, herbaria and libraries, as well as smaller organisations such as royal societies, field naturalist clubs and other learned societies and community groups, who may never have had the resources to do this critical work without this support.</p>

<p>This work has unlocked treasures such as the first published descriptions the Echidna <a href="https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304529">https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304529</a> (1792), and the Platypus <a href="https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304567">https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304567 </a>(1799). These descriptions are now freely accessible, easily discoverable and persistently citable (via DOIs) on the BHL website.</p>

<p>The BHL Australia team prioritises the digitisation of Australian-published biodiversity literature. The literature scanning operation is housed  at Melbourne Museum, where journals, monographs, archival material and grey literature are digitised. A significant proportion of the  canning, post-processing and metadata addition is undertaken by a team of dedicated BHL volunteers, many of whom have been with the project since the very beginning.</p>

<p>Providing free, online access to biodiversity literature greatly benefits researchers and decision makers working in the fields of taxonomy (naming and categorising species), ecology and conservation. In particular, providing access to the first descriptions of species greatly benefits the taxonomic community as all descriptions of new or revised species must be referenced to species concepts that have been put forward before. </p>



<p>Assigning DOIs (digital object identifiers) is an important component of BHL Australia’s work. DOIs make the historic literature discoverable; they provide a unique and permanent link to each scientific description online, enabling authors, publishers, and taxonomic databases (such as the ALA) to persistently link to (and find) that literature.</p>



<p>Historic literature is critical to our understanding of Australia’s biodiversity, particularly our understanding of changes in species distribution and  abundance. Since 2010, BHL Australia, and our evergrowing number of Australian contributors, have made almost 400,000 pages of Australia’s biodiversity literature openly accessible online. </p>
