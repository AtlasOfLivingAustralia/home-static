<p>Welcome to the June 2023 edition of our ALA newsletter.</p>



<p>Biological collections play an important role in understanding trends in biodiversity life sciences. With advances in genomics, imaging, artificial intelligence and machine learning, more information can be obtained from physical-biological specimens than has ever been possible before. </p>



<p>The ALA has been proud to play a key role in ensuring data emerging from Australia’s collections is made findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable globally. Recently, the ALA was pleased to partner with our key stakeholders across the museums, collections and herbaria sectors to host a national workshop in Canberra. The workshop &#8211; <em>‘Towards a national approach to biological collections’ </em>– brought together experts to explore current capabilities, emerging research drivers and key components that are required to support biological collections in Australia. Having our partners from across the nation meet together <a>highlighted the maturity and cohesiveness of our sector</a>, as well as the opportunities for international collaboration and improving data connections to deliver greater scientific benefit. We look forward to continuing collaborations to further advance work in this space at a national level. T<a>his will be pivotal in informing future priorities and co-investment pathways aligning with the recently released National Research Infrastructure Roadmap. </a></p>



<p><a>In addition </a>to a focus on collections for the rest of the year, we look forward to further engaging with the broader scientific community through multiple <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/where-to-find-the-atlas-of-living-australia-this-year/">conferences</a> such as the Ecological Society of Australia event in Darwin and the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) event in Hobart in the coming months. You’ll also find an exciting line-up of virtual events to support <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/national-science-week-2023/">National Science Week </a>in August which I encourage you to register for participation.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy our June newsletter.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://events.csiro.au/Events/2023/June/16/ALA-NSW-Maximising-your-metadata">Webinar Event: ALA National Science Week: Maximising your metadata for citizen science</a></strong> </p>



<p><strong>Thursday 17th August 2023, 1-2PM AEST</strong></p>



<p>Citizen science is an accessible gateway for anybody to engage in science regardless of age, location or demographic. Integrated citizen science apps take in millions of species occurrence records each year, which are then verified before being fed through to the ALA to become open and accessible data.</p>



<p>In this workshop, learn from industry experts about what makes a great species observation record, and learn tips and tricks for collecting the best quality&nbsp;metadata&nbsp; – data about data. Higher quality metadata (attributes like location, images, date of collection, etc.) helps to paint a more detailed picture of Australia’s biodiversity. More accurate metadata also helps to identify native vs. invasive species more readily for better biosecurity monitoring.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How would you look up information on species and natural history? Would you do a Google search or visit your local library? How about checking out the <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> (BHL)! It’s the world’s largest virtual library of biodiversity heritage literature and archival materials and contains materials published as far back as the 1400s! This incredible resource contains information on millions of the world’s species. This information – the foundation of our understanding of biodiversity – is freely accessible online for everyone.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia</a> in collaboration with Museums Victoria launched the Australian branch of the BHL in 2010. Since 2010, <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/collection/bhlau">BHL Australia</a> has grown from a single contributing organisation to 42, representing every state and territory across the country. Museums Victoria continues to host the project today BHL Australia staff and volunteers have now digitised over 500,000 pages of Australia’s biodiversity literature.</p>



<p>The knowledge in the BHL digitised pages includes scientific descriptions of Australia’s plants and animals and provides details of past distribution and abundance, allowing us to track changes across time. This information is invaluable to modern researchers, policy makers and educators.</p>

<p>One of the most significant publications made available on the BHL website is George Shaw’s <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/79941"><em>The Naturalist’s Miscellany</em></a>, from Museums Victoria’s Rare Book Collection. Shaw was an English naturalist and zoologist. His ground-breaking publication, <em>The Naturalist’s Miscellany,</em> consists of 24 volumes published in monthly instalments (fascicles) between 1789 and 1813. It contains scientific descriptions (in both English and Latin) of over 1000 species that were sent to London from around the world in the late 1700s and early 1800s. It covers an impressive range of species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, spiders, shells, and other marine organisms. Each description is accompanied by a spectacular illustration by Frederick Polydore Nodder, or, in the later volumes, his son Richard. Unprecedented in its scope and depth, <em>The Naturalist’s Miscellany</em> aimed to educate readers while highlighting the magnificence and diversity of nature.</p>



<p>Due to the timing of this significant work, <em>The Naturalist’s Miscellany</em> contains the first published scientific descriptions of many iconic Australian species, including (in 1790), the first scientific description of any species of kangaroo. At this time, the study of natural history was an esteemed academic pursuit backed by scientific rigour. George Shaw’s descriptions contain obvious awe and sometimes scepticism as he struggles fit Australia’s bizarre creatures into the current understanding of the natural world.</p>



<p>In Shaw&#8217;s description of the kangaroo, he notes the female is “furnished with a ventral pouch”. And his wonder just builds from here. He says:</p>



<p><em>The Kanguroo is a very anomalous and extraordinary quadruped…It is a creature of surprising agility, and springs forwards, by leaping to so uncommon a height, and to so great a distance, as to outstrip the fleetest pursuit; the swiftest greyhound being easily and soon distanced by this wonderful quadruped.</em></p>

<p><em>Caption: The Great Kanguroo, </em>(Macropus giganteus)<em> [Pl. 33] in Shaw, George (1790) The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany (vol. 1) <a href="https://doi.org/10.5962/p.310685">https://doi.org/10.5962/p.310685</a></em></p>



<p>In 1792, Shaw introduced the echidna (the Porcupine Ant-Eater) to the wider world. He writes:</p>



<p><em>This extraordinary animal may well be considered amongst the most curious and interesting quadrupeds yet discovered …since it is not only an absolutely new and hitherto unknown species …but is also a most striking instance of that beautiful gradation, so frequently observed in the animal kingdom, by which creatures of one tribe or genus approach to those of a very different one.&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="870" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3-1024x870.png" alt="" class="wp-image-48484" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3-1024x870.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3-300x255.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3-768x652.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3-790x670.png 790w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3.png 1354w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>Caption: The Porcupine Ant-Eater, </em>(Myrmecophaga aculeata) <em>[Pl. 109] in Shaw, George (1792) The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany (vol. 3)</em></p>



<p>In 1799, George delivered the platypus’s international debut:</p>



<p><em>Of all the Mammalia yet known it seems the most extraordinary… the perfect resemblance of the beak of a duck engrafted onto the head of a quadruped…it naturally excites the idea</em> <em>of some deceptive preparation by artificial means.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="818" height="835" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48485" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3.jpg 818w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3-294x300.jpg 294w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-3-768x784.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px" /></figure>



<p><em>Caption: The Duck-Billed Platypus, </em>(Platypus anatinus) <em>[Pl. 385-386] in Shaw, George (1799) The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany (vol. 10) <a href="https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304567">https://doi.org/10.5962/p.304567</a></em></p>



<p>So bizarre was this creature that Shaw questions whether it is indeed a real animal. The specimen Shaw based his description on is in Natural History Museum in London. If you were to examine this specimen, you would see the cuts around the bill made by Shaw in his efforts to find stitches. He was convinced the specimen was a hoax; that the bill of a duck had been sewn onto the body of something like a water rat. Shaw’s description of the platypus is one of only a few out of the 1000 that is accompanied by two plates. It seems that addition illustration – or perhaps proof – was required for those species that were truly perplexing. &nbsp;</p>



<p><em>The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany</em> left an indelible legacy on the field of natural history. It played a vital role in the development of zoology as a discipline, providing an extensive compilation of species, many of which had not been previously documented. Shaw&#8217;s meticulous observations, combined with the detailed illustrations, enabled future naturalists and scientists to study and identify species with greater precision.</p>



<p>As we commemorate the International Day for Biological Diversity, the significance of this publication, and the historic literature as a whole, resonates deeply. The world is currently facing an unprecedented loss of species due to various factors, including habitat destruction, climate change, and other human activities. Some of the species described in <em>The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany</em>, such as the Great Auk and the Dodo, are now extinct.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="302" height="471" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48486" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-4.jpg 302w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/05/BHL-4-192x300.jpg 192w" sizes="(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /></figure>



<p><em>Caption: The Dodo,</em> (Didus ineptus)<em> [Pl. 123] in Shaw, George (1799) The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany (vol. 4) <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/44515507">https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/44515507</a></em></p>



<p>These examples serve as reminders of the irreversible loss that can occur when species are not adequately protected and conserved. They emphasise the importance of ongoing efforts to preserve and restore biodiversity to prevent further extinctions and maintain the delicate balance of ecosystems.</p>



<p><em>The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany</em> is just one of the 180,000+ titles (60 million+ pages) made freely available on the BHL website by the 550+ contributing organisations across the world. What better way to spend International Day for Biological Diversity (May 22) than by exploring this invaluable resource.</p>



<p><em>BHL Australia acknowledges the traditional custodians of the land upon which we work: </em><em>the Boon Wurrung and Woiwurrung peoples of the Eastern Kulin Nation. We would also like to acknowledge the First Peoples of every part of Australia because that acknowledgement is generally missing from the material we work with. The publications discussed in this article </em><em>contain no acknowledgement that there were already people on these lands who had an extensive knowledge of both the biology and behaviour of these species.</em></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/04/Fungi-Friday-20-1024x577.png" alt="" class="wp-image-48394" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/04/Fungi-Friday-20-1024x577.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/04/Fungi-Friday-20-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/04/Fungi-Friday-20-768x433.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/04/Fungi-Friday-20-1536x865.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/04/Fungi-Friday-20.png 1640w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Galah <em>(Eolophus roseicapilla)</em> drinking from a river</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are many ways of getting data out of the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), including tools such as the <a href="https://spatial.ala.org.au/">Spatial Portal</a>, <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/biocollect/">Biocollect</a>, and <a href="https://ecoassets.org.au/">EcoAssets</a>. However, getting data directly into your own custom analysis program &#8211; a valuable tool for researchers &#8211; previously hasn’t been as straightforward. To bridge this gap, Matilda Stevenson, Martin Westgate, Dax Kellie and Peggy Newman created an ALA software package in the R programming language called {<a href="https://galah.ala.org.au/">galah</a>}.&nbsp;</p>



<p>{galah} has been designed to be an easy-to-access tool that helps coders, researchers, decision-makers, and citizen scientists better understand and visualise data in the ALA. For example, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88800-8_48-1">first publication citing {galah}</a> was just released, outlining the important need for conservation of marsupials in the north-eastern tropics of Australia. Some notable studies of {galah}’s previous iteration {ALA4R} include <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR20070">tracking the seasonal movement and impact of invasive buffalo across northern Australia</a>, estimating the total (and undiscovered) <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2115329119">number of trees on Earth</a>, as well as <a href="https://researchsystem.canberra.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/62608058/Hemming_Kyle.pdf">analysing native and exotic grass groups</a> with different carbon storing capacities (C3/C4) and their relationship with varying environmental gradients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The extension of {galah} into <a href="https://galah.ala.org.au/Python/">Python</a> expands the usability of the tool to allow users to retrieve data in a platform that they may be more familiar with. In 2023, <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/meet-caitlin-an-ala-indigenous-internship-student-with-a-flare-for-coding/">Caitlin Ramsay</a> &#8211; an ALA Indigenous Internship student &#8211; was the first to use the Python extension of {galah} to <a href="https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2023-04-28_plotting-invasive-species/post.html">understand the expansion of invasive species, both native and introduced, into Australia</a>. Such work could even be extended to other countries as the Python version of {galah} hosts, not only the Australian, but also the <a href="https://www.sibbr.gov.br/">Brazilian</a> and <a href="https://www.gbif.es/">Spanish</a> living atlases.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://galah.ala.org.au/Python/">access Galah 0.1.0 (Python) here</a>. It&#8217;s also now available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). Instructions on how to install, use and explore the features of this package are available at<a href="https://galah.ala.org.au/Python/"> galah.ala.org.au/Python</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Check out the <a href="https://galah.ala.org.au/Python/">Python extension of {galah}</a>, and discover helpful tips &amp; tricks for coding on <a href="https://labs.ala.org.au/">ALA Labs</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Collections specimens are valuable resources in genomics as they provide a historical record of the diversity of life on earth. By analysing the DNA and other biological markers from these specimens, researchers can gain important insights into this diversity and inform conservation efforts to protect our species. When these kinds of data are aggregated from multiple sources, researchers can pool their knowledge, compare results, and build on one another&#8217;s work – essential for driving innovation and advancing our understanding of the natural world.</p>



<p>This webinar brings together experts from three projects to discuss their work in this space. It is ideal for researchers, practitioners, and anyone interested in the latest developments in genomics and biological collections, and the mobilisation of these data.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The one stop-shop for Australian biosecurity data, project, and partner information.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p>With over 7.6 million hectares of land and 60,000 km of coastline, Australia is vulnerable to the introduction of new biosecurity threats every day. As an island nation, much of the biodiversity found in Australia is unique, therefore introduced species encroaching on our ecosystems can have devastating effects on native flora and fauna.</p>



<p>It is estimated that there are now more introduced species in Australia than native species, but until recently, data to support this has been elusive. <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/#tab_pane-B">The Atlas of Living Australia</a> (ALA) aggregates biodiversity data from native and introduced species found in Australia, making species occurrence information available to governments, land holders, policymakers, researchers and the public, for open-access use.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Myrtle-Rust-Austropuccinia-psidii-Photo-Credit-Pete-Woodall-CC-BY-NC-1-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-47715" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Myrtle-Rust-Austropuccinia-psidii-Photo-Credit-Pete-Woodall-CC-BY-NC-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Myrtle-Rust-Austropuccinia-psidii-Photo-Credit-Pete-Woodall-CC-BY-NC-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Myrtle-Rust-Austropuccinia-psidii-Photo-Credit-Pete-Woodall-CC-BY-NC-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Myrtle-Rust-Austropuccinia-psidii-Photo-Credit-Pete-Woodall-CC-BY-NC-1.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Invasive fungal disease &#8211; Myrtle Rust (<em>Austropuccinia psidii) </em>Photo Credit Pete Woodall CC BY NC</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ALA currently holds information on more than 2,383 exotic species and 1.9 million occurrences of pests, weeds, and diseases. Through the automated aggregation of data from more than 900 data partners, and the development of the ALA Biosecurity Hub, the ALA aims to connect people and systems to create a wholistic and informed picture of biosecurity in Australia.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/biosecurity/">ALA Biosecurity Hub</a> is a one-stop-shop for biosecurity records, projects and information that leverages ALA’s existing biodiversity infrastructure. It makes biosecurity data more findable and accessible to the biosecurity sector and aggregates several ALA biosecurity tools including:</p>



<ul>
<li>ALA Biosecurity Alerts System</li>



<li>Invasive Species Taxonomy</li>



<li><a href="https://lists.ala.org.au/public/speciesLists?&amp;max=25&amp;sort=listName&amp;order=asc&amp;isInvasive=eq:true">Invasive Species Lists</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/biosecurity/">ALA Biosecurity Hub</a> aggregates information across ALA partnered projects such as <a href="https://www.biosecuritycommons.org.au/">Biosecurity Commons</a> and <a href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/biocontrolhub">Australian Biocontrol Hub</a> in one place.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Red-Fox-Vulpes-vulpes-iNaturalist-KHarrison42-91932867.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-47706" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Red-Fox-Vulpes-vulpes-iNaturalist-KHarrison42-91932867.jpg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Red-Fox-Vulpes-vulpes-iNaturalist-KHarrison42-91932867-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Red-Fox-Vulpes-vulpes-iNaturalist-KHarrison42-91932867-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/12/Red-Fox-Vulpes-vulpes-iNaturalist-KHarrison42-91932867-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Invasive carnivore species &#8211; Red Fox <em>(Vulpes vulpes</em>).

<p>ALA Biosecurity Data Analyst Andrew Turley said the development of the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/biosecurity/">ALA Biosecurity Hub</a> would be critical in supporting Australia’s Border Force to detect pests early and act.</p>



<p>“Biosecurity affects us every day &#8211; from the way we care for the environment, to protection measures governments implement to manage livestock, plants, and food safety from an economic and health perspective,” Dr Turley said.</p>



<p>“Not only does the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/biosecurity/">ALA Biosecurity Hub </a>allow for early notification and detection of pests, it’ll make data more accessible so governments, researchers and industries can implement measures to better protect Australia’s biodiversity.”</p>



<p>Museums Victoria Senior Curator Dr Ken Walker agreed, acknowledging the value of consolidated biosecurity resources in defending against and responding to threats.</p>



<p>“It is important to have a resource that is not only accessible by government and researcher sectors, but also by citizen scientists to be able to better identify emerging threats before their impact becomes widespread,” Dr Walker said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, data aggregated in the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/biosecurity/">ALA Biosecurity Hub</a> has been used in Australia’s State of the Environment reports. These data were used to quantify the trend of increasing diversity and abundance of invasive species across Australia, with invasive species also identified as the most common pressure on threatened species in Australia.</p>

<p>Taxonomists work in the field of biological classification, and their work is critical to ensuring we can understand and protect Australian species into the future.</p>



<p>To celebrate Taxonomist Appreciation Day on 19 March, we sat down with the Atlas of Living Australia’s (ALA) Engagement Team Lead Dr Ely Wallis to find out more about her career and taxonomy experience.<em> </em><em></em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="769" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/03/Ely-Sept2022-1024x769.jpeg" alt="Photo of Ely Wallis" class="wp-image-48339" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/03/Ely-Sept2022-1024x769.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/03/Ely-Sept2022-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/03/Ely-Sept2022-768x577.jpeg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/03/Ely-Sept2022-1536x1154.jpeg 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/03/Ely-Sept2022-1920x1442.jpeg 1920w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/03/Ely-Sept2022-640x480.jpeg 640w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2023/03/Ely-Sept2022.jpeg 2046w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>ALA Engagement Team Lead Dr Ely Wallis</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>1. Why is the field of taxonomy so important to the ALA’s work?</strong></p>



<p><em>Taxonomy provides the mechanism to identify and classify organisms. It’s vital to the ALA because the name of the species observed is one of the three core pieces of information (with location and date) that is required to create a species occurrence record. It’s estimated that only about a third of the +700,000 species found in Australia have been given a scientific name.</em></p>



<p><em>Aggregating species data is reliant on the records being accurately identified at the lowest resolution of the taxonomic hierarchy possible. Identifying organisms in a particular place is important to making decisions about natural resource management and understanding changing climates.</em></p>



<p><em>Taxonomy provides a way to both get data into the ALA and to search for data. All incoming data points are matched to the ‘taxonomic backbone’ or placed into the classification hierarchy in the ALA infrastructure.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s important to be aware that taxonomic names are not static and are continually being revised. This is because researchers learn more (through techniques such as genetic analysis) to better understand how to delineate species. The ALA is on a constant journey to update our taxonomic backbone, to ensure our structure is as current and accurate as possible.</em></p>



<p><strong>2. Tell us about taxonomy in your career?</strong></p>



<p><em>I wouldn’t call myself a taxonomist, both my honours and PhD projects were in zoophysiology rather than taxonomy, but I have been around taxonomy since I started working at Museums Victoria after my PhD in 1995. Earlier than that, I’ve had an interest in collecting biological things since I was a child. I would collect shells at the beach, sorting, identifying, and labelling them. Even as a nine-year-old, I would pack a bag full of books alongside my beach towel, so that I could identify my finds. I had a logbook for recording what I collected each year, so I guess that’s where it started!</em></p>



<p><em>I think that for many people, wanting to know what an animal or plant is called is their first interaction with taxonomy – even if they wouldn’t put it that way. At Museums Victoria, I led a fantastic team to develop&nbsp;</em><a href="https://museumsvictoria.com.au/apps/national-field-guide-apps/"><em>The National Field Guide</em></a><em>&nbsp;apps project. It was a collaborative project with museums around Australia to write species descriptions, gather photographs and sounds to allow anyone to identify common species near them.</em></p>

Development of this app was led by Ely’s team in Museums Victoria.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Scientific literature is vital to taxonomy. Another project that supports taxonomy that I am involved with is the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/collection/bhlau"><em>Biodiversity Heritage Library</em></a><em>&nbsp;(BHL). This global project digitises and makes scientific literature freely accessible to anyone. The Australian BHL supports over forty publishers to digitise Australian published literature. This project also assigns DOIs so that articles can have a persistent and resolvable identifier so researchers can find those papers. I was very proud to start the BHL project in Australia and am lucky to have travelled all over the world with literature.</em></p>

<p><em>I am the current Chair of the international organisation called Biodiversity Information Standards (</em><a href="https://www.tdwg.org/"><em>TDWG</em></a><em>) which develops and maintains the standard for&nbsp;</em><a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/"><em>Darwin Core</em></a><em>&nbsp;(the international standard for sharing biological data). I also sit on the steering committee for&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.taxonomyaustralia.org.au/"><em>Taxonomy Australia</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p><em>In the ALA we also collaborate with communities on Country to document and share Indigenous language names for plants and animals through the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/indigenous-ecological-knowledge/"><em>Indigenous Ecological Knowledge</em></a><em>&nbsp;program. Language words and descriptions of species are published, with consent, on the ALA website and I am proud to be able to play a small part in that project.</em></p>



<p><strong>3. Tell us about the species named after you!</strong></p>



<p><em>The species named after me (Birubius wallisae) is a type of crustacean, an amphipod. Amphipods are small creatures (less than a centimetre) and common in marine environments. The amphipod named after me is found around Moreton Bay in Queensland. It’s about 5mm long so you need a good microscope to look at it. It was named after me by my good friend Dr Joanne Taylor at Museums Victoria. Jo named the&nbsp;species after me in appreciation of the support I was able to give her while she was completing her PhD. The literature publication (which is required to recognise a validly named species) for Birubius wallisae is open-access and can be found&nbsp;</em><a href="http://doi.org/10.24199/j.mmv.2001.58.15"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>2023 will be an exciting year for the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and our partners in the biodiversity data sector with Australia hosting two major international events later this year. </p>



<p>First, in partnership with CSIRO’s National Research Collections Australia we are excited to bring the <a href="https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2023/">Biodiversity Information Standards TDWG</a> (Taxonomic Data Working Group) conference to Hobart from 9 &#8211; 13 October. TDWG sets and evolves international standards such as <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/">Darwin Core</a> that make the work that ALA and our partners do possible. In addition to TDWG’s focus on biodiversity informatics, science applications of biodiversity data will feature prominently at the conference, so we warmly invite you to get involved – who doesn’t enjoy a major science event on the Hobart waterfront?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, the ALA has been proud of its ongoing partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gbif.org/" target="_blank">GBIF</a>) where we’ve gained enormous value from relationships with the international GBIF network. At last year’s GBIF Governing Board meeting in Brussels, the ALA and our biological collections partners in CSIRO successfully bid to host the 2023 meeting of the Governing Board in Australia. The meeting will follow directly from the TDWG event and will be hosted in Canberra in mid-October. It’s been 20 years since Australia hosted a meeting of the Governing Board and we are excited to welcome our international partners. </p>



<p>Finally, I’d like to reflect on a remarkable experience our team had over recent months hosting two Indigenous Internship students. We welcomed <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/meet-caitlin-an-ala-indigenous-internship-student-with-a-flare-for-coding/">Caitlin Ramsay </a>(University of New South Wales) and <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/diving-into-dingo-data-with-amos-smith/">Amos Smith</a> (University of Western Australia) who partnered with our Science and Decision Support team over the summer period on two applied projects. As a team, we gained so much from their involvement in our work, and it was rewarding to provide them with some insight into the role of national research infrastructure in Australia’s science and innovation system. For me, it highlighted the value of bringing diversity and new ideas into a team, and the responsibility more established institutions such as the ALA have in supporting our upcoming research infrastructure specialists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy our March newsletter. </p>
