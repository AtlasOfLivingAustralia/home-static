<p>Who knew that ‘cake’ could help save the planet? Every year, wildlife lovers, conservationists, and ‘baking enthusiasts’ alike come together for an event like no other: the &#8216;Threatened Species Bake Off&#8217;. This quirky and creative competition, hosted as part of Australia’s Threatened Species Day (7th September), highlights endangered native animals and plants through the medium of delicious baked goods.</p>



<p>The concept is simple: bake a treat inspired by one of Australia&#8217;s many threatened species, whether it’s the critically endangered Eastern Curlew, the iconic Koala, or even a lesser-known species like the Wollemi Pine. The idea is to raise awareness of the biodiversity crisis while having a bit of fun in the kitchen.</p>



<p>But why bake? While conservation efforts traditionally focus on research, policy, and habitat restoration, the bake-off taps into something more universal: food and creativity. By encouraging people to express their love for endangered species through cake, biscuits, and cupcakes, this event engages a broader audience that might not otherwise be involved in conservation conversations. Plus, who can resist a beautifully decorated cake shaped like a bilby?</p>



<p>A Recipe for Change</p>



<p>The Bake Off shines a light on species at risk of extinction, but it also allows us to celebrate their beauty and importance. Participants research their chosen species, learning about their habitats, threats, and the conservation efforts in place to protect them. This process creates a deep connection between the baker and their species, sparking conversations with family and friends about biodiversity loss.</p>



<p>And while the cakes are the stars of the show, the underlying message is vital: Australia is facing an extinction crisis. Over 1,800 species of animals and plants are listed as threatened under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Habitat destruction, climate change, and invasive species are driving many of these species towards extinction. The Threatened Species Bake Off is a sweet reminder that we need to take action.</p>



<p>How It Works</p>



<p>The rules are simple: choose a threatened species, bake something inspired by it, and share your creation on social media with the hashtag #ThreatenedSpeciesBakeOff. It’s a great way to get involved whether you’re a novice baker or a seasoned pro.</p>



<p>Judges are often well-known figures from the conservation world, who will assess entries on creativity, accuracy in depicting the species, and, of course, how delicious the bake looks! While the competition is friendly, the impact is serious: each entry raises awareness of the need for urgent action to protect Australia’s biodiversity.</p>



<p>Get Involved</p>



<p>Even if you’re not the best baker, the Threatened Species Bake Off is a fun way to learn about Australia’s unique wildlife and help spread the word about the threats they face. By participating or sharing posts about the bake-off, you’re contributing to a larger conversation about biodiversity and conservation.</p>



<p>So, dust off your apron, grab your mixing bowl, and get creative for a cause. Because sometimes, the best way to start saving the planet is with a slice of cake.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Why did we publish this book?</strong>?</p>

<p>Tidying messy data can be difficult, but it is a task that anybody who works with data must face if they want to use data to tackle scientific questions!</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia&#8217;s (ALA) Science &amp; Decision Team recently authored a book titled&nbsp;<a href="https://cleaning-data-r.ala.org.au/">Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</a>. This free resource provides up-to-date information on data cleaning processes for anybody who handles their data using code in R. As Australia’s national biodiversity database, the ALA is frequently asked questions about the best way to clean data using code.&nbsp; To provide advice on this topic, our first step was to investigate what the currently accepted “best” way might be. We deep-dived into multiple recent peer-reviewed research to see whether experts cleaned their biodiversity data in the same way.</p>
</div>

</div>



<p>Through this process we discovered that the steps to clean ecological data can be really messy! Even among experts, data cleaning can look completely different depending on the type of investigation and study species. No wonder people ask how to do it!</p>



<p>This book is our response to questions about how to clean biodiversity data in R. The book provides guidance on many of the processes for cleaning biodiversity data.</p>

<p><strong>What’s covered in the book and who is it for?</strong></p>



<p>In <em>Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</em>, we provide an overview of a typical biodiversity data cleaning workflow for open-access geo-referenced biodiversity data—from acquisition, to error identification, to correction. These processes are broken down into sections on exploring data, general data cleaning, and data cleaning processes that require expertise in your study species. The book has information suited to those just starting out working with biodiversity using R, to those who are looking for more advanced techniques.</p>

<p>We hope that&nbsp;<a href="https://cleaning-data-r.ala.org.au/">this resource</a> can help support your data cleaning tasks in the future, and act as a useful learning or reference tool for teaching and sharing knowledge around data cleaning.</p>
