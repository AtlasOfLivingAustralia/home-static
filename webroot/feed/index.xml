<p><strong>Tuesday 16 August, 2022</strong></p>



<p>As Australia’s national biodiversity database, the Atlas of Living Australia delivers trusted data services for Australia, supporting world-class biodiversity research and decision-making. Our data are used by a range of professionals from different fields, such as research, government, museums &amp; herbaria, and industry, just to name a few. As diverse as these fields are, they all share something in common, and that’s the potential for an exciting career in STEM. In this webinar, hear from three speakers who have followed their passions to forge unique and rewarding career paths in STEM.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2019/20 bushfires across Australia had devastating impacts for humans and the environment. However, these bushfire events also elicited strong community interest in aiding the recovery efforts to rehabilitate the natural environment. The Multi Regional Citizen Science Bushfire Recovery Projects were designed to identify and bridge gaps between scientists and communities by increasing understanding of environmental recovery and increasing community awareness and involvement in bushfire recovery monitoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of these projects was The Big Bushfire BioBlitz.</p>

<p>The Big Bushfire BioBlitz included three weekend events in Summer and Autumn 2022 across the&nbsp;Mid North Coast of NSW with surveys in Crowdy Bay and Dooragan National Parks, the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, and Murramarang National Park on the south coast of NSW. BioBlitzes were chosen as the survey method because they are community events with “a focused effort to record as many species as possible in a defined location within a limited period of time,” Thomas Mesaglio, iNaturalist curator and PhD candidate at the UNSW Evolution &amp; Ecology Research Centre. &nbsp;</p>

As part of the BioBlitz activities, burnt versus un-burnt areas were surveyed and compared. While results are still being analysed, a quick comparison of burnt and unburnt areas for the Mid-North Coast found that burnt areas contained 30 bird species while unburnt areas contained 70 bird species. I Information such as this helps to map species distribution, abundance and changes as the result of bushfire activity.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-value-of-a-bioblitz"><strong>What’s the value of a BioBlitz?</strong></h4>



<p>BioBlitz initiatives provide an opportunity for wide-spread community involvement and opportunity for new data records at a point in time to be captured, ingested and verified by experts to inform monitoring and research. From the Autumn Big Bushfire BioBlitz, all records have been fed through into the ALA via iNaturalist.</p>



<p>BioBlitzes also offer a hands-on educational experience with the aim to inspire increased environmental stewardship.</p>



<p><em>“Citizen science events such as bioblitzes provide an invaluable opportunity to maximise the amount of data collection, intensely focusing on particular areas, as well allowing people of all skill levels to be involved. Participants get to interact with and learn from experts, and also offer their own local expertise and insights to the experts, so it’s a fantastic two-way transfer of knowledge.”</em> Thomas Mesaglio, iNaturalist curator and PhD candidate at the UNSW Evolution &amp; Ecology Research Centre. &nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="where-to-from-here"><strong>Where to from here?</strong></h4>



<p>From the 2022 Big Bushfire BioBlitz, the ALA in collaboration with our partners intend to create a guide for local governments and community groups on how to run other small-scale BioBlitz initiatives. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="partnerships"><strong>Partnerships:</strong></h4>



<p>This work was supported by the Australian Government’s $200 million Bushfire Recovery Program for Wildlife and their Habitat.</p>



<p>The BioBlitzes were coordinated by the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/#tab_pane-B">Atlas of Living Australia</a>, in collaboration with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/ecosystem">University of New South Wales (UNSW)&nbsp;Centre for Ecosystem Science</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.minderoo.org/fire-and-flood-resilience/">Minderoo Foundation’s Fire and Flood Resilience Initiative</a>, the former&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/">Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://citizenscience.org.au/">Australian Citizen Science Association</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We recently released a significant update to our name-matching index, to ensure the ALA taxonomy (names and classification of species) is as up-to-date as possible. Many changes occurred behind the scenes, and some may be more noticeable.

Read on to find out more about the ALA taxonomy update, why we did it, and how it might impact your use of the ALA.]]></description>

<h2 id="taxonomy-is-a-moveable-feast"><strong>Taxonomy is a moveable feast&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Like most fields of study, taxonomy is not static. As new species are discovered, and others are reclassified, it’s important to stay on top of what belongs in which group. Adding to this challenge is the fact that different taxonomists and organisations can also disagree on certain points. For example, one source might classify a species as part of one family, but another source will classify them in a completely different family.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="taxonomy-is-the-backbone-of-the-ala"><strong>Taxonomy is the backbone of the ALA</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Because we hold information relating to species, the ALA relies on a taxonomic ‘backbone’ to sort and arrange all of the data we receive. While we recognise that there can be some disagreement within the field, ultimately we need to select a way of classifying species in order to present the data. We do this using several sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For plants, we primarily rely on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/names" target="_blank">Australian Plant Name Index</a> (APNI)/<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/program/hc/hc-APC.html" target="_blank">Australian Plant Census</a> (APC), whereas for animals we refer to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/home" target="_blank">Australian Faunal Directory</a> (AFD). Fungi is covered by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fungi.biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/" target="_blank">AusFungi</a>, and mosses, by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://moss.biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/" target="_blank">AusMoss</a>. Our friends across the Tasman aren’t forgotten either, with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nzor.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Organisms Register</a> (NZOR).&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="changes-that-have-happened-behind-the-scenes"><strong>Changes that have happened behind the scenes</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Our taxonomic backbone sits in the background of ALA. When it’s accurate and up to date, it’s not too noticeable, but when it’s inaccurate, that’s when issues arise. Below are the key updates we’ve made to the back end of the system:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Refreshed the main sources: AFD, APNI/APC, AusFungi, AusMoss, NZOR&nbsp;</li><li>Updated source information for sources such as <a href="https://www.cmar.csiro.au/data/caab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota</a> (CAAB)&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The recent updates mean that the ALA taxonomy is now in line with the most up-to-date information available.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="changes-you-might-notice"><strong>Changes you might notice</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<ul><li>The identifiers that we use for some species have changed. In some cases, this is because the species has been moved to a different position in the taxonomic tree. In other cases, particularly animals, the type of identifier supplied by the source has changed.&nbsp;</li><li>The changes above will flow through to individual species, so you may notice changes in how particular species, as well as higher taxonomic groups, are now classified&nbsp;</li><li>Sensitive species information and conservation data were revised for all states and territories, as were the lists of invasive and pest species. You may notice changes in names, with some new additions to these lists (and some removals)&nbsp;</li><li>More Indigenous language names for species were added (read more about our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ala.org.au/indigenous-ecological-knowledge/" target="_blank">Indigenous Ecological Knowledge</a> (IEK) projects)&nbsp;</li><li>Lichens from the <a href="https://lichen.biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/taxonomy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Species Lists</a> (NSL) were added&nbsp;</li><li>Single-celled organisms such as Chromista and Protozoa had previously been classified under parallel ‘trees’ in the ALA back end, due to information feeding from different sources. We’ve now unified the sources, so these organisms are placed where they belong. &nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2 id="why-weve-updated-and-what-it-means-for-you-our-users"><strong>Why we’ve updated, and what it means for you, our users</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>These updates have been made to improve the accuracy of our data, and your experience using them. There are now fewer anomalies in our taxonomy, with more accurate classifications of some species. The ALA now has greater alignment with more recent versions of our source data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The field of taxonomy can change quickly, so by refreshing the ALA sources we keep data in the ALA as up-to-date as possible. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="ecoassets-is-now-live"><strong>EcoAssets is now live!</strong></h2>



<p>Through EcoAssets, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) are delivering open, integrated data to support national environmental reporting and assessment needs.</p>



<p>Having access to quality data with a broad reach is critical to this kind of national reporting, such as the recently released State of the Environment Report.</p>



<p>Until recently, the data required for environmental assessment have only been available through separate data systems. Datasets historically have not been well integrated to support environmental reporting, especially at national, state and territory levels. By making it simpler and faster to obtain integrated data, EcoAssets will enhance reporting efforts and support improved environmental decision-making.</p>

<h2 id="streamlined-data-to-increase-reporting-capabilities"><strong>Streamlined data to increase reporting capabilities</strong></h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ecoassets.org.au/data/" target="_blank">Seven datasets</a> are now publicly and freely available for biodiversity reporting and assessment. The primary biodiversity data asset offered by EcoAssets is the&nbsp;aggregated <a href="https://ecoassets.org.au/data/aggregated-data-australian-species-occurrences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Australian species occurrence data</a> asset, which enables users to explore the data by threatened species status, bioregion, protected area category, and more. This provides coverage for Australian terrestrial and marine systems. A future release will include an environmental monitoring and observation summary dataset.</p>



<p>By increasing alignment between data, the research infrastructures have created not only these first release datasets, but also data pipelines to ensure each data asset can be updated at regular intervals – speeding up reporting and assessment efforts in the future.</p>

<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>



<p>We had so many wonderful questions. Please see below for answers to the questions we didn&#8217;t quite get to:</p>



<p><strong>Q. Are there laws around the movement of dirt (fill) in fire ant areas? It is common practice in my area to seek fill. How do you discourage the community from seeking out fill and raise awareness around the risks associated with moving dirt?</strong></p>



<p>A. Andrew Turley: Yes, there are restrictions on the movement of fire ant carriers regulated through the&nbsp;<em>Biosecurity Act 2014.&nbsp;</em>However, many materials can be moved safely if appropriate mitigation measures are taken. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fireants.org.au/treat/business-and-industry/movement-controls" target="_blank">The National Fire Ant Eradication Program website</a> is the best source of information about this. Restricting movement relies heavily on advertising, community engagement and cooperation, though we do have a compliance team that routinely checks businesses and respond to community reports of illegal movements too.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q. Do events like flooding risk larger-scale movements of ants, or other species?</strong></p>



<p>A. Andrew Turley: Yes. Fire ants originate from the Amazon floodplains, and whole colonies can form large rafts and float during flooding events (see this recent media <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/the-ants-go-rafting-invasive-fire-ants-take-to-australian-flood-waters-to-colonise-new-areas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article from The Guardian</a> discussing this). In SEQ, we&#8217;re lucky that all fire ants are east of the great dividing range and the rivers/creeks flow eastward back into the infested area. As such, the impact of flooding on fire ant eradication efforts is minimal at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q. How do you deal with taxonomic inconsistency? For invasive species, the ALA, GBIF, and CABI are not consistent. Is there an expert input process?</strong></p>



<p>A. Paul Tudman: The Biosecurity Commons platform will provide a suite of online tools for analysing data and provide easy access to online data repositories through a data catalogue. However, assessing the quality of the data that is used in any analysis will fall on the shoulders of the practitioner. We may investigate the challenge of taxonomic inconsistency between repositories in future versions of the platform but that is currently out of scope for the proof-of-concept stage of the project.</p>

<p>The ALA’s field data collection system – BioCollect – is getting brand new look. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The look and feel will be fresher, cleaner and more intuitive. You can still design your own data collection projects, collect data, share your project with partners, and make the data accessible via the ALA – all in a new design.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new design will be rolled out this May.</p>



<p>Visitis&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/biocollect-all" target="_blank">https://biocollect.ala.org.au/biocollect-all</a> to get started.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The BioCollect makeover – what’s new and what’s changed</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The user interface design for BioCollect has not changed since it’s launch, so it was time for an uplift.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The update is mostly cosmetic, we simplified the interface without losing any of the great functionality. There are also some new features. You can now create projects in your own personal space and publish the project to the world only when you’re ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also some improvements to the document search and view feature on the project resources page. Even more improvements will be coming in the near future too.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>BioCollect – a flexible biodiversity data collection tool</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>BioCollect can be used to meet the specific data collection needs of citizen science projects, non-citizen science projects or natural resource management projects. It was first released in 2015, and is now widely used by researchers, industry ecologists, citizen scientists, non-government organisations and government organisations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Echidna CSI – a BioCollect case study</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>A research project run by Dr Tahlia Perry at the University of Adelaide uses data collected by citizen scientists to study echidnas. The project has had a huge impact on echidna research and conservation. The research team developed a bespoke mobile app using BioCollect as its database.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flexible data collection tool enabled the research team to ‘recruit’ an army of citizen scientists across the country and collect the data necessary to establish an Australia-wide distribution map of Short-Beaked Echidnas (<em>Tachyglossus culeatus</em>). The project has doubled the number of echidna records in the ALA and discovered new facts about echidna biology. <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/echidna-csi-using-citizen-science-to-track-echidnas-throughout-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more about Echidna CSI.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Collect, store, manage and share with BioCollect</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re running a field data collection project, why not give BioCollect a try. You can collect data for your own project, store and manage the data, and, when you’re ready to share the data, it can go straight into the ALA automatically.&nbsp;</p>
