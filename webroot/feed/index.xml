<p>In 2019 researchers at the Australian National Wildlife Collection (ANWC) at CSIRO and the Trace and Environmental DNA Laboratory at Curtin University extracted and sequenced DNA from three 50-year-old eggshells from the ANWC avian egg collection. They used it to reconstruct near-complete mitochondrial genomes, a first using eggshells of non-ratite birds.</p>



<p>Today, a team from ANWC and the Australian National University announced DNA can be extracted from very small eggshells held in museum collections without causing damage to the integrity or appearance of the specimen. The team demonstrated how their new sampling technique can be used to confirm the identity of unknown specimens.</p>



<p>Around the world there are nearly 5 million eggshell specimens held in natural history collections. Many were collected by hobbyists in the past, before egg collecting was made illegal in most countries.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/01/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-1024x1007.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44538" width="309" height="304" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/01/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-1024x1007.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/01/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-300x295.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/01/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-768x755.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/01/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO.png 1144w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" /><figcaption>Eggs specimens shown before (left) and after (right) drilling to extract DNA for this study. Image credit: ANWC, CSIRO.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“To be useful for scientific research, eggshells need to have accurate metadata, which includes information about when and where the specimen was collected and what species it belongs to. But bird eggshells often lack metadata because the eggs of different species can look very similar,” said lead author Alicia Grealy.</p>



<p>“In this study we examined 45 different eggshell specimens from ANWC that lacked metadata. We compared different sampling methods, such as swabbing the surface of eggshells, but ultimately optimised a drilling technique to retrieve eggshell powder. This provided us with sufficient DNA to identify the species while keeping the specimen intact,” Alicia said.</p>



<p>The team cross-checked the species IDs they generated by using the Atlas of Living Australia to compare the morphology of each egg specimen with published reference photographs of that taxon.</p>



<p>“We then put the method to the test on a clutch of eggs in ANWC that purportedly were of the extinct Paradise Parrot,” Alicia said.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:5cc6c8d2-50dc-4c9f-9b12-5423b6da6f18">Paradise Parrot (<em>Psephotellus pulcherrimus</em></a>) was listed as extinct in 1927. It lived in south-east Queensland and laid its nondescript white eggs inside termite mounds. Collected in 1967, the clutch of eggs had been identified as belonging to the Paradise Parrot and this has been contested for more than 50 years.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/01/Parrots_egg_ANWC-CSIRO.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44528" width="368" height="237"/><figcaption>Egg specimens are valuable records of where and when birds have bred in changing environments and can inform how their distributions are changing. This Paradise Parrot egg specimen from the Australian National Wildlife Collection was used in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79852-4">study published in Nature</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“Our study confirmed that this clutch belonged to the common and far from extinct <a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:cb0bc816-19d5-4291-8f4f-006582bbdf50">Eastern Bluebonnet, <em>Northiella haematogaster</em></a>. Fraud and misidentifications like this can have serious implications for research that relies on accurate occurrence records for threatened and endangered species,” Alicia said.</p>



<p>“We hope our research will help egg collections in museums worldwide be better utilised for research that supports biodiversity and conservation management,” Alicia said.</p>

<p>As part of our celebrations to mark 10 years of the ALA, we would like to thank all our data partners for all their contributions over the decade.</p>



<p>Our data partners are the backbone of the ALA, providing species occurrence data as well as authoritative data for species names and classification, geospatial references, and environmental layers.</p>



<p>We now have over 700 data partners across research, government and citizen science and over 91 million biodiversity records.</p>



<p>Here are our top 10 data partners – in terms of number of occurrence records – in our plant, invertebrates, non-avian invertebrates and bird datasets.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amateur naturalist Liz Barratt caught this candid photo of a European Honey Bee on her property in Moffatdale, Queensland.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/12/bee-by-lizbarratt_iNaturalist-866x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44479" width="408" height="483" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/12/bee-by-lizbarratt_iNaturalist-866x1024.jpg 866w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/12/bee-by-lizbarratt_iNaturalist-254x300.jpg 254w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/12/bee-by-lizbarratt_iNaturalist-768x908.jpg 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/12/bee-by-lizbarratt_iNaturalist.jpg 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /><figcaption>European Honey Bee (<a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/taxa/47219"><em>Apis mellifera</em></a>) caught on camera by Liz Barratt (All rights reserved © lizbarratt).</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“This was the first year I’d seen our bottlebrush in full bloom and it had a lot of bees around it so I got my camera out.&nbsp; I sat there for several hours over several days just happily snapping away and watching them,” Liz said.</p>



<p>“When I downloaded the photos, I realised I had caught this shot and looked up ‘bee peeing’ on the internet. From there, I’ve been on this journey and found out more about bees than I ever expected!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her quest for more information, Liz contacted Entomologist Juanita Rodriguez at CSIRO’s Australian National Insect Collection, who confirmed the sighting was pretty rare.</p>



<p>“This is a rare event Liz captured and she took an excellent photo. &nbsp;Bees release liquid waste called uric acid, but they release it in such small amounts so it’s unusual to witness it – and images like this are rare,” said Juanita.</p>



<p>Uric acid is a liquid waste that is formed in a bees malpighian tubules – the insect equivalent of kidneys. Here, it’s mixed with other waste products before it is expelled out of the body. The amount of uric acid that’s released is very small. This makes an image capturing this moment very rare.</p>



<p>Because of this, Juanita encouraged Liz to upload the observation to iNaturalist Australia. This enabled the sighting to become a useful piece of biodiversity data accessible via the ALA. The <a href="https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/observations/65599556">observation</a>, known as an occurrence record, contains useful data such as location, date, time as well as information about the species.</p>



<p>There are many different apps that feed data into the ALA. For a full list of apps and citizen science projects search the <a href="https://biocollect.ala.org.au/acsa#isCitizenScience%3Dtrue%26isWorldWide%3Dfalse%26max%3D20%26sort%3DdateCreatedSort">Australian Citizen Science Project Finder</a>.</p>



<p>“I knew this was a rare photograph, and I thought there must be someone somewhere who can use this photo for bee education or similar. But I was at loss on where I could post it to share it properly,” said Liz.</p>



<p>“I was really grateful to learn about iNaturalist and am really happy to share it with others who also may find it interesting. I love my little bee photo – I’ve called him Bubble Bum due to the bubble on his bum!” </p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/02/AcroRd32_2020-02-05_14-55-47.png" alt="ALA Data Quality Project icon" class="wp-image-43643" width="204" height="194"/></figure></div>



<p>Since the project launch in&nbsp;February this year the Data Quality project team has been working with&nbsp;the ALA user community&nbsp;to identify&nbsp;data quality related issues and develop solutions.&nbsp; Thank you to everyone who completed our surveys,&nbsp;contributed to our understanding of the baseline&nbsp;perceptions of data quality,&nbsp;helped to&nbsp;prioritise&nbsp;the issues,&nbsp;and tested&nbsp;solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Prioritisation survey results</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>After establishing a baseline for perceptions of data quality (<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/data-quality-project-baseline-survey-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see results</a>), we conducted a&nbsp;prioritisation&nbsp;survey to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;which&nbsp;issues&nbsp;the data quality project&nbsp;address&nbsp;first. The top two issues identified&nbsp;were:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Users of the ALA are using data accessed via the ALA without filtering out records that are not fit for purpose.&nbsp;</li><li>I don’t know whether to use particular records or datasets for my purpose because quality indicators are not visible, or I don&#8217;t understand what the information means.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Data Quality project first release – improvements to data filters</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to the issues above,&nbsp;the project developed a&nbsp;new&nbsp;capability&nbsp;to&nbsp;pre-filter search results so that lower quality records&nbsp;(such as&nbsp;those with incomplete or inconsistent data)&nbsp;are not shown unless they are actively included.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The filters can be seen in a new&nbsp;Data Profile&nbsp;section&nbsp;above the&nbsp;search results.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/11/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44446" width="680" height="147" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/11/image.png 602w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/11/image-300x65.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>The new release enables users to switch filters on&nbsp;or&nbsp;off&nbsp;and manage&nbsp;them&nbsp;as a group or individually.&nbsp;Information is available on the&nbsp;fields and data that make up the filters&nbsp;through mouse-over text and&nbsp;clickable info icons (i).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get involved, <a href="https://biocache-dq-beta.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=">join beta testing of the new Data profiles</a> feature. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s a pleasure to be invited to provide this guest editorial to help celebrate the Atlas of Living Australia’s 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary.</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) was developed in 2010 to support the needs of the national and international research community for timely access to Australian biodiversity data. In this time, it has grown into one of the world’s foremost biodiversity infrastructures and leads Australia’s commitment to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>).</p>



<p>The Australian biodiversity information community, partnering with the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (<a href="https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris">NCRIS</a>), should be proud of our national and global achievements. One of many remarkable achievements is the <a href="https://living-atlases.gbif.org/">international Living Atlases</a> community. This now delivers science impact globally through 27 national atlases built on ALA-developed infrastructure, shared Australian capability and knowledge.</p>

<p>In this anniversary year, it’s timely to reflect on the history of the ALA. Its origins owe much to the vision, commitment and partnerships that were already in place in the museums, collections and herbaria sectors and we are proud to be part of this story. In the late 1990s, the peak body for herbaria in the region, the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria (CHAH) formed a consortium with the Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS) to digitise and database specimens resulting in the Australasian Virtual Herbarium (<a href="https://avh.ala.org.au/">AVH</a>).</p>



<p>The museum community has a similar story. The zoological collections formed the Council of Heads of Australian Faunal Collections (CHAFC) in 1992 with a national viewpoint on museum-held biodiversity data issues, an exchange of ideas and interactions with ABRS and Environmental Information Resources Network within what is now the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment. Following the success of the AVH, CHAFC sought to improve the sharing of data through then newly evolving web technology. This resulted in the Online Zoological Collections of Australian Museums, or <a href="https://ozcam.org.au/">OZCAM</a> in 2002.</p>



<p>The establishment of the ALA owes its foundation to the prior existence of AVH and OZCAM and this history runs deep in the architecture of the ALA. More importantly the strength of these existing networks, partnerships and governance models provided a sound foundation for accelerating the vision under the newly formed NCRIS program in 2007.</p>



<p>From its origins in the collections sector, the ALA has astutely expanded its remit to broaden the portfolio of data and services it offers Australian science and decision-making. The inclusion of biodiversity data from state government agencies, major research programs and its support of the citizen sector has significantly improved our understanding of Australia’s biodiversity.</p>



<p>The events we’ve witnessed in 2020 provide a timely reminder of the criticality of maintaining a comprehensive, representative and adequate national biodiversity infrastructure. It is fundamental to improving our understanding of the impact of current and future bushfires and other environmental threats, on biodiversity and supporting ensuing restoration efforts. It provides fundamental data to help understand the global behaviour of zoonotic diseases and their role in future pandemics, and it can position Australia to more effectively deal with biosecurity risks that impact our environment and economy.</p>



<p>Reflecting on the strategic priorities for our sector – &nbsp;for example around higher throughput digitisation of our collections and the rapid growth in genomics-based methods in biodiversity sciences – &nbsp;we believe we are extremely well placed to grow and evolve to meet these challenges through our ongoing partnerships with the ALA.</p>



<p>In closing, we acknowledge the significant vision and contribution made through the Australian Government’s NCRIS program in realising the ALA vision, and the partnerships that have been so fundamental to its success. This includes the thought leaders, the data partners and ALA’s institutional supporters that can rightfully be proud of what Australia has achieved.</p>

<p>The ALA brings together occurrence record data, taxonomic information, spatial and historical information on species distributions, and environmental data. These data are central to the research areas of ecology, conservation, environmental planning, Indigenous ecological management and sustainability.</p>



<p>The ALA’s contribution to the research output in these fields has steadily increased over the last 10 years. Now over 2,300 scientific publications have referenced the ALA, providing novel contributions to a range of fields.</p>



<p>Researchers have used data from ALA to show <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00720">changes in Platypus numbers over the last 150 years</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2032">identify rare species that thrive in Australian towns and cities</a>, and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12856">understand complex migration behaviour in insects</a> that would otherwise go undetected. Images stored by the ALA have even been used to build apps that can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2019.8803746">automatically identify Australian insects</a> in the field.</p>



<p>As our data holdings continue to grow, researchers continue finding new ways to draw on ALA in their research, bettering the understanding of Australia’s unique biodiversity. Now, you can search and browse some of this research through our new webpage, <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/ala-cited-publications/">ALA-cited publications</a>.</p>



<p>If you are a researcher and use the ALA to access data or analytical tools, read <a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000195866-how-to-cite-the-ala">How to cite the ALA</a> for more detail on best practices for citing and acknowledging the ALA.</p>



<p><strong>Ten years of the ALA</strong></p>



<p>Ten years ago, Australian national collections, science organisations, and government agencies saw the opportunity for a national online and open data repository for biodiversity data. The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) was established with funding from the Australian Government’s National Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) to fulfill this role and aggregate Australia’s biodiversity data.</p>



<p>“The ALA has changed the way biodiversity research and environmental decision making occurs in Australia,” said ALA Director Dr Andre Zerger.</p>



<p>“We now have over 90 million occurrence records and function as the most comprehensive dataset on Australian biodiversity. The ALA has over 78,000 registered users and access to 700 datasets from data partners across research, government and citizen science.” he said.</p>



<p><strong>Built on partnerships</strong></p>



<p>Central to the success of the ALA are the contributions from our data partners. They are the backbone of the ALA, providing authoritative data for species names and classification, geospatial reference data, environmental layers, and species occurrence data. </p>



<p>“The work of the organisations and institutions that provide data, and manage, curate and update that data, underpins our success and we look forward to continuing and growing these partnerships over another ten years,” said Andre.</p>



<p>The diverse datasets all contribute to the rich tapestries of data that are accessible via the ALA, and enable the ALA to perform like a window into the complex world of biodiversity science.</p>



<p><strong>National and global reach</strong></p>



<p>The ALA not only delivers Australia’s biodiversity data at a national level, it also contributes to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world&#8217;s governments to provide open access to data about all types of life on Earth.</p>



<p>“Through the GBIF living atlases community, the infrastructure our team first developed 10 years ago is now being used by 27 countries around the world to manage their biodiversity data,” said Andre.</p>



<p>The ALA is the Australian node of GBIF and has significantly contributed to this global network for open biodiversity data access.</p>
