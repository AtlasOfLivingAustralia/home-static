<p>In this issue, we are pleased to present you with our Year in Review for 2021-22. Our Year in Review showcases ALA’s highlights, and reflects on the fundamental contribution made by our partners in supporting our mission. 2021-22 was an important year for the ALA, highlighted by some innovative new capability releases including <a href="https://labs.ala.org.au/">ALA Labs</a>, our work with partner NCRIS facilities to establish and launch <a href="https://ecoassets.org.au/">EcoAssets</a>, and the inaugural launch of the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/abdmp/">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program</a>. Last year was also a time of significant team growth for the ALA and we now have staff in six  capital cities working with our partners, our projects and supporting our applications and systems. Having a national team has been a welcome by-product of some of the constraints imposed upon us over the past few years. Finally, doing justice to the breadth of research we enable in any year is always a challenge, but we’ve showcased four stellar examples of how a national biodiversity data infrastructure enables Australian science. We hope you enjoy reading our 2021-22 story as much as we’ve enjoyed building it.</p>



<p>I was recently privileged to represent the Australian delegation at the Governing Board meeting of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) held for the first time in person in three years in Brussels, but also supporting a hybrid model. It was a great opportunity to connect with people we only ever see virtually. It&#8217;s nice to see the shared challenges, understand where our partners are heading strategically and benchmark ALA’s approach both technically and strategically. The global context is different to ours but nevertheless, we run a federated data infrastructure built on strong relationships across many sectors, so we learn so much at these events. An additional highlight for me was attending a one-day symposium hosted by GBIF and the European Biodiversa+ program called Data Beyond Borders that explored the role data infrastructure can play in supporting major national research and policy programs. This is clearly one of the next frontiers for capabilities such as ALA, and our partners in the NCRIS program.</p>



<p>The GBIF experience has affirmed the importance of ALA’s international role, and the opportunities this affords moving forward. Our delegation concluded the meeting with a successful nomination to host the 2023 Governing Board Meeting in Canberra – it’s been almost 20 years since Australia played this role and we are excited to welcome our international partners in 2023.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been some years since we’ve all travelled and engaged in person, but our team have been re-energised by this year’s conference season. This has included our recent participation in eResearch Australasia in Brisbane, remote participation in the TDWG international meeting, GBIF in Europe, and in-person participation at the Ecological Society of Australia conference in Wollongong in November. I’d like to conclude by acknowledging the groups and individuals that do such an amazing job designing, coordinating, and running conferences to support our sector.&nbsp; We appreciate the work you do! We hope you enjoy our November edition.</p>

<p>We’ve just released a new API gateway to access our APIs: <a href="https://docs.ala.org.au/">docs.ala.org.au</a>! Over 130 API endpoints have been migrated across to Swagger in a beta release, and we’re working on making more available very soon.</p>



<p>ALA is passionate about empowering and supporting great research, so we’ve released APIs which were only used internally in the past. You can now use these in your work to access our open-source data more easily and feed into downstream analyses using your own system. We can’t wait for you to try them out and let us know what you think!</p>

<h4 id="what-about-security"><strong>What about security?</strong></h4>



<p>The new portal will increase security for both ALA and you, our user. By moving to JSON Web Tokens (JWT), we’re able to open up access to previously unreleased APIs.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 id="jwt-tokens-but-isnt-ala-providing-access-to-open-data"><strong>JWT tokens? But isn’t ALA providing access to open data?</strong></h4>



<p>Yes, we still are! (And we’re still free to use too).</p>



<p>Most of our APIs&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;require authentication and can be accessed freely as documented in the relevant Swagger specifications found at&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.ala.org.au/">docs.ala.org.au</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the protected APIs (such as sensitive or private data), you’ll need a&nbsp;JWT, which can be generated via a Client ID and Client Secret&nbsp;– let us know if you require this and we can assist.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4 id="whats-happening-to-the-existing-api-portal"><strong>What’s happening to the existing API portal?</strong></h4>

<p>Does it croak or growl, have fangs or howl? Does it scream at night or give you a fright? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f383.png" alt="🎃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Many iconic living (or dead) things that are seen around Halloween are inspired by species in the natural world! Check out some of the most spook-tacular Aussie species!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1009" height="541" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-47481" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC.jpg 1009w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/10/Goblin-Shark-Mitsukurina-owstoni-Museums-Victoria-CC-BY-NC-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px" /><figcaption>Goblin Shark (<em>Mitsukurina owstoni</em>) Museums Victoria CC BY NC</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/b1b5f1e3-1efa-4d18-b8f7-d26731b964cc#overview">Goblin Shark (<em>Mitsukurina owstoni</em></a>)</strong></p>



<p>Talk about a creature from nightmares, the Goblin Shark is one of the most illusive deep-sea sharks known to scientists with a distinctive blade-like snout and pink skin. Specimens have been found along continental slopes at distances up to 1.3 km deep, measuring 3-4 metres in length. The Goblin Shark has distinctive mouthparts, specialised for rapid projection as their jaws can extend and retract to catch prey.</p>



<p>They are the only extant member of the&nbsp;<em>Mitsukurina</em>&nbsp;genus, often called a ‘living fossil’ as this genus traces back 125 million years. These sharks are incredibly illusive, with limited specimens recorded around NSW, Victoria and Tasmania in Australia, as well as Portugal and Japan. Not much is known about the reproductive life cycle of this species as a pregnant Goblin Shark has never been recorded.</p>

<p>If the pumpkin-orange colour doesn’t scare you off, maybe its stench will! This stinkbug produces a rotten-smelling spray from the chemical ‘cimicine.’ This spray doesn’t just pack a pungent punch, its main function is to be a defensive mechanism against predators – most commonly other arthropods and birds – which can be lethal to these species. To humans, the spray can cause significant irritation. This is a classic case of ‘look but don’t touch’, no matter your species!</p>



<p>As eggs and nymphs, Bronze Orange Bugs are green in colour but as they mature through their five instar stages of development, they acquire their distinctive orange colour to resemble citrus leaves. They are considered pests in commercial citrus orchards across eastern Australia.</p>

<p>It’s not just it’s physical appearance that’s scary, this plant’s impact on biosecurity is equally terrifying.</p>



<p>Also known as the ‘cemetery flower’ or ‘common thorn apple’, this plant is one of the most invasive noxious weeds around the world, including in Australia. It has been known to poison humans and animals, reduce pasture productivity and compete with native flora.</p>



<p>A member of the nightshade family, Jimsonweed was originally introduced in Australia in the 1800s for medicinal and ornamental purposes. The most toxic part of the plant are its black seeds which disperse through water, contaminated hay and mud stuck to vehicles.&nbsp;The spiny seed capsule is as aggressive as it looks and will injure those who dare to touch…</p>

<p>Australia is home to more than 90 species of bats including both mega bats and micro bats. Although some bat species around the world do feed on blood (and are most likely the inspiration for Halloween stories), the Spectacled Flying Fox is more likely bring you joy rather than terror!</p>



<p>These endangered fruit bats live in the northern tropics and feed on native fruits, flowers, and myrtle plants. They play a pivotal role in rainforest ecosystems as seed dispersers and pollinators. Aptly named, the Spectacled Flying Fox has light yellow fur around its eyes and snout giving the appearance that its wearing glasses. They typically live to be around 12 -15 years old in the wild but have been known to live up to 30 years old in captivity.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/3898">Far Eastern Curlew</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/3898"><em>Numenius madagascariensis</em></a>)</strong></p>



<p>A shriek in the night, a blood curdling scream, you investigate the source only to find…a Far Eastern Curlew?</p>



<p>Known for making exceptionally long migratory travels to breed between northern and southern hemispheres, Far Eastern Curlews are also iconic for their scream-like vocalisation calls.&nbsp;They use their hauntingly beautiful calls as part of mating displays and to assert dominance over their territory.</p>



<p>With a long scimitar-shaped beak which can be more than 50% the length of their body and dark-streaked plumage, the Far Eastern Curlew is the largest shorebird in the world. This species is reliant on mudflats and mangrove swamps for feeding and breeding. Unfortunately, this species is listed as ‘endangered’ due to loss of habitat, causing population decline across their ranges.</p>

<p>Hairy, spotty and slime green! Could this spider be the ultimate creature for Halloween?</p>



<p>Orbweaver spiders are common across Australia, known for making intricate, sticky webs at night to catch prey. Orbweavers occupy crevices and leaves during the day, and if they feel significantly threatened, they will drop to the ground and ‘play dead.’</p>



<p>The Speckled Orbweaver prefers to occupy green foliage, to blend in with the surroundings. As with many spider species, females are larger than males at approximately 6mm in length, with males 3mm in length.</p>

<p><strong><u><a href="https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https:/id.biodiversity.org.au/node/fungi/60094367">Ghost Fungus <em>(Omphalotus nidiformis</em></a></u></strong>)</p>



<p>Like something out of a fairy-tale, Ghost Fungi glow through their gills with a green-tinged light. They emit ‘cold light’ where less than 20% of light emitted is capable of radiating heat. Ghost Fungi, and other bioluminescent creatures, fluoresce using a compound called ‘luciferin’. They grow on dead or decaying wood and are commonly found across Australia in temperate areas. The exact reason this species uses bioluminescence is not known, however a theory is that by glowing the fungi attracts insects which disperse its spores.</p>



<p>Ghost Fungi are poisonous if consumed, however are often mistaken for Oyster Mushrooms due to their similar fan-like appearance and milky-white colouration in the daytime.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday 16 August, 2022</strong></p>



<p>As Australia’s national biodiversity database, the Atlas of Living Australia delivers trusted data services for Australia, supporting world-class biodiversity research and decision-making. Our data are used by a range of professionals from different fields, such as research, government, museums &amp; herbaria, and industry, just to name a few. As diverse as these fields are, they all share something in common, and that’s the potential for an exciting career in STEM. In this webinar, hear from three speakers who have followed their passions to forge unique and rewarding career paths in STEM.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2019/20 bushfires across Australia had devastating impacts for humans and the environment. However, these bushfire events also elicited strong community interest in aiding the recovery efforts to rehabilitate the natural environment. The Multi Regional Citizen Science Bushfire Recovery Projects were designed to identify and bridge gaps between scientists and communities by increasing understanding of environmental recovery and increasing community awareness and involvement in bushfire recovery monitoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of these projects was The Big Bushfire BioBlitz.</p>

<p>The Big Bushfire BioBlitz included three weekend events in Summer and Autumn 2022 across the&nbsp;Mid North Coast of NSW with surveys in Crowdy Bay and Dooragan National Parks, the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, and Murramarang National Park on the south coast of NSW. BioBlitzes were chosen as the survey method because they are community events with “a focused effort to record as many species as possible in a defined location within a limited period of time,” Thomas Mesaglio, iNaturalist curator and PhD candidate at the UNSW Evolution &amp; Ecology Research Centre. &nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="the-results-are-in-how-did-we-do"><strong>The Results are in: How did we do?</strong></h4>



<p>The 2022 Big Bushfire BioBlitz delivered incredible results with 7,955 observations, 1,768 species recorded, 115 observers and 479 identifiers! See below for a species-specific breakdown. As part of the BioBlitz activities, burnt versus un-burnt areas were surveyed and compared. While results are still being analysed, a quick comparison of burnt and unburnt areas for the Mid-North Coast found that burnt areas contained 30 bird species while unburnt areas contained 70 bird species. I Information such as this helps to map species distribution, abundance and changes as the result of bushfire activity.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-value-of-a-bioblitz"><strong>What’s the value of a BioBlitz?</strong></h4>



<p>BioBlitz initiatives provide an opportunity for wide-spread community involvement and opportunity for new data records at a point in time to be captured, ingested and verified by experts to inform monitoring and research. From the Autumn Big Bushfire BioBlitz, all records have been fed through into the ALA via iNaturalist.</p>



<p>BioBlitzes also offer a hands-on educational experience with the aim to inspire increased environmental stewardship.</p>



<p><em>“Citizen science events such as bioblitzes provide an invaluable opportunity to maximise the amount of data collection, intensely focusing on particular areas, as well allowing people of all skill levels to be involved. Participants get to interact with and learn from experts, and also offer their own local expertise and insights to the experts, so it’s a fantastic two-way transfer of knowledge.”</em> Thomas Mesaglio, iNaturalist curator and PhD candidate at the UNSW Evolution &amp; Ecology Research Centre. &nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="where-to-from-here"><strong>Where to from here?</strong></h4>



<p>From the 2022 Big Bushfire BioBlitz, the ALA in collaboration with our partners intend to create a guide for local governments and community groups on how to run other small-scale BioBlitz initiatives. &nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="partnerships"><strong>Partnerships:</strong></h4>



<p>This work was supported by the Australian Government’s $200 million Bushfire Recovery Program for Wildlife and their Habitat.</p>



<p>The BioBlitzes were coordinated by the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/#tab_pane-B">Atlas of Living Australia</a>, in collaboration with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/ecosystem">University of New South Wales (UNSW)&nbsp;Centre for Ecosystem Science</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.minderoo.org/fire-and-flood-resilience/">Minderoo Foundation’s Fire and Flood Resilience Initiative</a>, the former&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/">Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://citizenscience.org.au/">Australian Citizen Science Association</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We recently released a significant update to our name-matching index, to ensure the ALA taxonomy (names and classification of species) is as up-to-date as possible. Many changes occurred behind the scenes, and some may be more noticeable.

Read on to find out more about the ALA taxonomy update, why we did it, and how it might impact your use of the ALA.]]></description>

<h2 id="taxonomy-is-a-moveable-feast"><strong>Taxonomy is a moveable feast&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Like most fields of study, taxonomy is not static. As new species are discovered, and others are reclassified, it’s important to stay on top of what belongs in which group. Adding to this challenge is the fact that different taxonomists and organisations can also disagree on certain points. For example, one source might classify a species as part of one family, but another source will classify them in a completely different family.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:14px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="taxonomy-is-the-backbone-of-the-ala"><strong>Taxonomy is the backbone of the ALA</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Because we hold information relating to species, the ALA relies on a taxonomic ‘backbone’ to sort and arrange all of the data we receive. While we recognise that there can be some disagreement within the field, ultimately we need to select a way of classifying species in order to present the data. We do this using several sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For plants, we primarily rely on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/names" target="_blank">Australian Plant Name Index</a> (APNI)/<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/program/hc/hc-APC.html" target="_blank">Australian Plant Census</a> (APC), whereas for animals we refer to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/home" target="_blank">Australian Faunal Directory</a> (AFD). Fungi is covered by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fungi.biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/" target="_blank">AusFungi</a>, and mosses, by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://moss.biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/" target="_blank">AusMoss</a>. Our friends across the Tasman aren’t forgotten either, with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nzor.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Organisms Register</a> (NZOR).&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="changes-that-have-happened-behind-the-scenes"><strong>Changes that have happened behind the scenes</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Our taxonomic backbone sits in the background of ALA. When it’s accurate and up to date, it’s not too noticeable, but when it’s inaccurate, that’s when issues arise. Below are the key updates we’ve made to the back end of the system:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Refreshed the main sources: AFD, APNI/APC, AusFungi, AusMoss, NZOR&nbsp;</li><li>Updated source information for sources such as <a href="https://www.cmar.csiro.au/data/caab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota</a> (CAAB)&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The recent updates mean that the ALA taxonomy is now in line with the most up-to-date information available.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="changes-you-might-notice"><strong>Changes you might notice</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<ul><li>The identifiers that we use for some species have changed. In some cases, this is because the species has been moved to a different position in the taxonomic tree. In other cases, particularly animals, the type of identifier supplied by the source has changed.&nbsp;</li><li>The changes above will flow through to individual species, so you may notice changes in how particular species, as well as higher taxonomic groups, are now classified&nbsp;</li><li>Sensitive species information and conservation data were revised for all states and territories, as were the lists of invasive and pest species. You may notice changes in names, with some new additions to these lists (and some removals)&nbsp;</li><li>More Indigenous language names for species were added (read more about our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ala.org.au/indigenous-ecological-knowledge/" target="_blank">Indigenous Ecological Knowledge</a> (IEK) projects)&nbsp;</li><li>Lichens from the <a href="https://lichen.biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/taxonomy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Species Lists</a> (NSL) were added&nbsp;</li><li>Single-celled organisms such as Chromista and Protozoa had previously been classified under parallel ‘trees’ in the ALA back end, due to information feeding from different sources. We’ve now unified the sources, so these organisms are placed where they belong. &nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>These updates have been made to improve the accuracy of our data, and your experience using them. There are now fewer anomalies in our taxonomy, with more accurate classifications of some species. The ALA now has greater alignment with more recent versions of our source data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The field of taxonomy can change quickly, so by refreshing the ALA sources we keep data in the ALA as up-to-date as possible. &nbsp;</p>
