<p>Did you know that small bodies of water in Australia&#8217;s cities, like ponds or retention basins, play a crucial role in the environment? These urban wetlands are vital for supporting clean water, healthy ecosystems, and even bird migration. However, urban wetlands are often highly modified or constructed bodies of water, and are therefore seen as less “valuable” from an urban planning lens in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem outcomes. </p>



<p>In a partnership between the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), the&nbsp;<a href="https://aurin.org.au/">Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">BirdLife Australia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://federation.edu.au/">Federation University</a>, a tool was created to raise awareness of the importance of wetlands in urban environments. The team used open-source citizen-science data to quantify the values of urban wetlands across Victoria, including those that have previously been overlooked. This information was collated into a publicly available online mapping tool, ‘<ins><a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/">Valuing Urban Wetlands</a></ins>’.</p>



<p><strong>The online tool</strong></p>



<p>The tool integrates waterbird and landscape data through an online portal called ‘<a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/"><em>Valuing Urban Wetlands</em></a><em>.</em>’ Waterbird data collected through citizen science and professional science was accessed via the ALA,&nbsp;<a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">BirdLife Australia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ebird.org/region/AU">eBird</a>&nbsp;and overlayed with open landscape data to create metrics for assessing wetland health and importance. The tool focuses on the Greater Melbourne region, but the methodology can be applied to other regions in the future</p>

<p>As a mega-diverse continent, Australia&#8217;s home to hundreds of thousands of species, with more being discovered every year. Despite this, Australia faces one of the highest species extinction rates, meaning that innovative methods to detect and understand our biodiversity are becoming increasingly important.</p>



<p>Advancing technologies like genomics, advanced imaging and machine learning are changing the way that researchers and policymakers respond to climate risks, species conservation and protection, biosecurity and decision-making.</p>



<p>In this webinar hosted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://ala.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b238aea31bbd4bd103ff7368c&amp;id=43167d8001&amp;e=3629824322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlas of Living Australia,</a>&nbsp;hear from three of our partners to explore how they’ve applied next-generation technology to support Australian biodiversity research.</p>



<p>The ALA receives support from the Australian Government through the <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/ncris">National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy</a> (NCRIS) and is hosted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>.</p>

<p>The 2024 programme will provide two €5,000 prizes (approx. AUD $8,200) recognising the work of two early-career researchers. Nominations are open to Masters and PhD students conducting innovative research using biodiversity data available through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gbif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a>&nbsp;(GBIF). The Atlas of Living Australia is the Australian node of GBIF, meaning all data in the ALA are also accessible via GBIF.</p>



<p>All applicants need to receive a formal nomination from the heads of delegation and node managers of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network">GBIF Participant countries</a>. This year our team at the Atlas of Living Australia will coordinate the applications from Australian researchers. We will select two nominations to be assessed by the GBIF Science Committee.</p>



<p><strong><em><mark>Australian applications to the ALA are due by 31st May 2024.</mark></em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Nomination process</strong></p>



<p>Two Australian nominations will be selected for submission to GBIF by the Australian GBIF Delegation in time for the GBIF submission deadline. Please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:outreach@ala.org.au">outreach@ala.org.au</a>&nbsp;if you require further information.</p>



<p>A jury organised by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?group=scienceCommittee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GBIF Science Committee</a>&nbsp;will select the two award recipients from the pool of nominees received from the country delegation by the GBIF Secretariat.</p>



<p>Note: Awardees are expected to acknowledge GBIF support when disseminating research results via peer-reviewed publications, presentations at professional meetings, and other media.</p>



<p><strong>Award nomination packet</strong></p>



<p>Candidates should prepare their proposal and nomination packets to include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">

How the research advances biodiversity informatics and/or the conservation of biological diversity.<br>b.&nbsp;<strong>The role of data accessed through GBIF in addressing these questions</strong>. Research proposals must clearly demonstrate how the study incorporates data mobilised through GBIF. Students with questions about GBIF-enabled data should work with academic advisors, their GBIF national node, the GBIF Secretariat or members of the Science Committee to increase their understanding.<br>c. The research scope, plan, methodologies, relevant literature citations and timetable.<br>d. If relevant, a description or an excerpt from a data management plan that outlines how data related to the research is published or will be prepared for publication through the GBIF network to GBIF.org.</li>
