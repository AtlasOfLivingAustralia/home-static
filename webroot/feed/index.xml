<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/03/ABDMP_logo-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-46572" width="413" height="232" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/03/ABDMP_logo-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/03/ABDMP_logo-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/03/ABDMP_logo-768x432.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/03/ABDMP_logo-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/03/ABDMP_logo.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" /></figure></div>



<p>Welcome to the March 2022 edition of our newsletter, in which we launch the <strong><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/the-ala-australian-biodiversity-data-mobilisation-program/">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program.</a></strong></p>



<p>This new program will provide grants to institutions to mobilise their data to the ALA. This could include the transcription of historical field sheets, acquisition of contemporary digital scanning technology, or even the development or purchase of software to provide better approaches to biodiversity data management and delivery. The ‘how’ will be up to the successful grant recipients, hence the program will offer maximum flexibility for successful applicants. We plan to award 6 grants in the first year of the program across both small ($20K) and large grants ($50K).</p>



<h3 id="why-were-creating-this-grant-program">Why we&#8217;re creating this grant program</h3>



<p>The success of the ALA as Australia’s biodiversity data infrastructure rests so much on the contribution made by its data partners across multiple domains. Data in the ALA comes from biological collections, museum and herbaria, state government, major research programs, non-government organisations and increasingly citizen scientists.</p>



<p>We partner with over 900 of these groups and individuals to harmonise Australia’s biodiversity data. Despite these partner contributions we remain acutely aware that for small institutions, or where historical data remains in analogue format, providing biodiversity data to the ALA remains a challenge, and we encourage you to apply for assistance through this new program.</p>



<p>I’ve been reflecting on the ecological data I collected as a researcher working across the south west slopes of NSW and parts of Victoria some years ago. I spent a decade supporting the collection of fundamental data about Australia’s flora and fauna. Much of this made its way into digital databases, at the time in CSIRO and the University of Melbourne. However, the ALA did not exist so this record although digital, remains undiscoverable.&nbsp; I also saw first-hand the filing cabinets of paper field sheets from my predecessors that provide a fundamental record of our biodiversity and may never be digitised.</p>



<p>With this context in mind, I am &nbsp;very excited to be launching the <strong><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/the-ala-australian-biodiversity-data-mobilisation-program/">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program</a>.</strong></p>



<h3 id="program-details-application-and-assessment">Program details: application and assessment</h3>



<p>Clearly there’s a massive amount of biodiversity data that remains un-digitised and the job of the evaluation panel will be to make informed assessments against defined criteria. Detailed guidelines will be published shortly on the <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blog/">ALA blog</a> and on our ALA social media channels &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/atlaslivingaust">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/atlasoflivingaustralia">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/1232460">LinkedIn</a>. Principles underpinning the program include alignment with national priorities and a focus on significant historical biodiversity information not currently available as FAIR data – findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable.</p>



<p>The program will be evaluated by an independent panel Chaired by Dr David Cantrill, one of the ALA Advisory Board’s longest serving members.</p>



<p>Our team is so excited by the opportunity this program will deliver Australia’s biodiversity community and already anticipates the legacy it will deliver. We look forward to seeing some fantastic applications.</p>



<p>I hope you enjoy our March 2022 newsletter.</p>



<p>Dr. Andre Zerger </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you work in an institution with historic biodiversity data? Our new grant program is designed to help you digitise, mobilise and share your biodiversity data via the Atlas of Living Australia. ]]></description>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/02/3-1-edited-1.png" alt="shelves full of folders" class="wp-image-46507" width="321" height="392"/><figcaption>Image: Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The <a href="https://ala.org.au/abdmp/">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program</a> is a grant program to support people and institutions make their biodiversity data more accessible.</p>



<h3 id="accessible-data-is-better-data"><strong>Accessible data is better data</strong></h3>



<p>Making your data open and accessible makes it more valuable. FAIR data – findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable &#8211; can be shared with other researchers and people working in biodiversity policy.</p>



<p>High quality and accessible biodiversity data helps conservation efforts and informs decision-making and solutions for environmental challenges.</p>



<h3 id="funding-to-support-your-digitisation-efforts"><strong>Funding to support your digitisation efforts</strong></h3>



<p>We know that organising, standardising, and digitising data takes time and effort. The ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program is here to help. The grant program will award small (up to $20k) and large (up to $50k) grants to biodiversity data owners to support purchasing equipment (e.g. camera, scanner) or employing staff in order to mobilise data.</p>



<p>Applications for the program opened on 14 March, 2022.</p>



<h3 id="who-can-apply"><strong>Who can apply?</strong></h3>



<p>We’re looking for institutions or biodiversity researchers who need help digitising historic physical records and mobilising data into the ALA.</p>



<p>There’s no catch, as long as the records are biodiversity-related. This can be for any wild species in Australia – from koalas to cane toads, eucalypts to bioluminescent fungi, we want to know about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The data might be in paper field notes, or species in physical collections. Whatever it is, we’ll be giving out grants to 6 institutions through both small ($20K) and large grants($50k).</p>



<p>You might be wondering why! Well, available data = useful data – so by making historical data accessible, it can be shared more widely and used by researchers to support biodiversity conservation efforts and decision-making.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.phrn.org.au/media/82231/ncris-stimulus-report-updated-final-31-august-2021-002.pdf">National Collaborative Research<br>Infrastructure (NCRIS) spending<br>and economic growth</a> found the direct benefit of investment in <a href="https://www.dese.gov.au/ncris">NCRIS</a> is calculated to be above a $7 return for every $1 invested, a return on investment (ROI) of 7.5:1. By 2022-23 the investment could support the employment of an additional 1,750 scientific and technical staff, support staff, and supply chain and industry staff -. These benefits along with others outlined in the report indicate the significant impact NCRIS has made on Australia’s economic security. The report concluded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Based on economic theory and evidence from the time of the GFC to present, we can think of few approaches to providing additional stimulus to the Australian economy that are more cost effective than increasing investment in NCRIS.”</em></p></blockquote>



<h3 id="ncris-delivers">NCRIS delivers</h3>



<p>The impact of <a href="https://www.dese.gov.au/ncris">NCRIS</a> is clear, however the program itself is not often centre stage. From supercomputers and microscopes, to data collection and software platforms NCRIS provides the infrastructure that supports Australia’s scientists.</p>



<p>The result is a network of world-class research facilities that are driving innovation and research in Australia and internationally. This network is made up of 22 NCRIS projects, which link over 200 institutions employing more than 1,900 highly skilled researchers and technical experts. This interconnected infrastructure and the specialist teams who run <a href="https://www.dese.gov.au/ncris">NCRIS</a> programs allow Australia to meet the key challenges outlined in the UN sustainability goals and tackle some of the biggest scientific and societal challenges we face today. These have been highlighted in the Lateral Economics report as:</p>

<p>The report describes how NCRIS also provides opportunities for international engagement and cooperation delivering &#8216;science diplomacy&#8217;.</p>



<p>The ALA is an excellent example of this. In its role as the Australian node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the ALA helped to establish the Living Atlases program in 2016, by which other nations (now 24) can establish their own biodiversity data systems.</p>

<p>#February11 is the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/women-and-girls-in-science-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Day of Women and Girls in Science</a>, a UN day declared in 2015 to empower, celebrate and champion women and girls in scientific disciplines. Despite the growth of women and gender-diverse people in STEM in recent years, a significant gender gap still remains.</p>



<p>In Australia, less than one quarter of STEM students at university and VET level are women, and five years after graduation, men with STEM qualifications are almost twice as likely to be working in a STEM-qualified occupation. Across all STEM industries, only 28% of workers are women, and even fewer are managers – just 23% of management positions are held by women (source: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.industry.gov.au/news/second-national-data-report-on-girls-and-women-in-stem" target="_blank">STEM Equity Monitor 2021</a>).</p>



<p>To celebrate #February11 in our own ALA way, we asked our team to share about a woman in science they find inspiring. We discussed the work of so many brilliant women – sharing links, books, podcasts and research papers around the office. Here is a small selection. Blog compiled and edited by Kylie Morrow, Digital Content Coordinator.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="karlie-noon"><strong>Karlie Noon</strong></h2>



<p>By Olivia Torresan, Support Officer</p>



<p>Karlie Noon is a Gamillaraay / Kamilaroi / Gomeroi woman from Tamworth, NSW. Her current research looks at investigating how the Milky Way galaxy finds new sources of hydrogen gas (which drives star formation). This research could potentially help inform us about the longevity of the galaxy we live within. In her spare time, Karlie has also contributed to researching Indigenous knowledge on moon halos – a light refraction phenomena that can aid in predicting rain events.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/02/karlie2.png" alt="&quot;&quot;" class="wp-image-46371" width="975" height="541" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/02/karlie2.png 700w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/02/karlie2-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /><figcaption><meta charset="utf-8">Photo: ABC Me and SBS</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Karlie is the first Aboriginal woman to attain a double degree in mathematics and physics. She has since pursued a Masters of Astronomy (Advanced) and is currently undertaking a PhD at the Australian National University. She credits her drive to learn maths not to school, but to one of the many strong women in her life: her Aunty.</p>



<p>I first came across Karlie in my early undergraduate years when studying a joint philosophy and maths unit in Cosmology. My undergraduate was a double degree in philosophy and environmental science. Though the class didn’t have an explicit focus on the connections between astronomy and ecology, I read about some of Karlie’s work (some which did just that) when doing some research. It fascinated me. It’s crazy to think that it wasn’t until I arrived at university that I felt I resonated with a female figure in STEM. Like Karlie, I’m a first-generation student. That said, I can only really imagine how further inspiring her work is for Indigenous women in STEM. She’s carried on from her elders; her family – who have thousands of years of intricate astronomical knowledge, precursing the likes of Galileo and Newton. That, of which, Western science still struggles to acknowledge.</p>

<h2 id="fernanda-werneck"><strong>Fernanda Werneck</strong></h2>



<p>By Jessica Fenker Antunes, Data Analyst/R Programmer</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/02/fernanda-1-768x1024.jpeg" alt="&quot;&quot;" class="wp-image-46424" width="475" height="626"/><figcaption><meta charset="utf-8">Photo: Werneck Lab</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Dr Fernanda Werneck works in the heart of the Amazon Forest (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Amazônicas, Brazil), investigating how climate change can affect biodiversity, and the implications for conservation. Besides that, Fernanda promotes and values Women in Science, having published many articles and presented at conferences about the feminine presence in biology. Fernanda is affiliated with the Brazilian Academy of Science, and a member of the “<a href="https://www.parentinscience.com/english">Parent in Science Brazil</a>” movement. In 2016 she won the “L’Oreal-Unesco-ABC prize for Woman in Science,” and the “L’Oreal-Unesco International Rising Talents For Women in Science” in the following year.</p>



<p>One of Dr Werneck’s recent projects that I find inspiring involves popularising the knowledge of the impact of climate change on Amazon biodiversity within Amazon traditional communities and schools. It involves experiences of immersion in the forest, hoping to raise awareness and awaken feelings of environmental citizenship in favour of simply preserving biodiversity.</p>



<p>I met Dr Werneck during my Master at Universidade de Brasília. At that time, she had just finished her PhD in the US and was moving back to Brazil. She taught me a lot about phylogenetic analyses and motivated me to pursue my research in biogeography and evolution. More than that, Fernanda is keen to support and discuss research and life with any student in the lab and maintain contact over the years. Personally, I find Fernanda inspiring as a Latina/Brazilian woman to reach a prestigious position while supporting many other women and girls to pursue the same. She is very approachable, curious, and talking with her you can see how much she loves what she does.</p>

<h2 id="shelley-james"><strong>Shelley James</strong></h2>



<p>By Ely Wallis, Collections Community Engagement Manager; Projects Team Lead</p>



<p>Collection managers working in herbaria and museum natural history collections bring a breadth of scientific knowledge to their task – from a deep understanding of taxonomy to identification techniques and tools, from specimen preservation and documentation to international science policy, collecting permit requirements and ethics. Australia boasts outstanding, highly skilled and knowledgeable collection managers. One of them is Dr Shelley James of the Western Australian Herbarium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shelley has been a botanical research scientist for more than two decades, studying and working in Australia and the USA.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://bionomia.net/0000-0003-1105-1850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bionomia</a></em>, a website that gives scientists credit for their collections work, shows that Shelley has collected over 4,400 specimens from at least four countries and has identified over 4,100 specimens from over 26 countries.</p>



<p>Not only does Shelley maintain an active research career but also gives back to the global community through her tireless efforts sitting on committees and volunteering her time to improve biodiversity science. Her service includes being the Oceania representative on the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) executive, Member at Large for the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections, and Chair of the Managers of Australasian Herbarium Collections. Her recent work has focused on the expansion and improvement of herbarium collections and biodiversity data and ways to best analyse, contribute to, understand, and better our conservation efforts in Western Australia, Australia and around the world.</p>

<h2 id="corrie-moreau"><strong>Corrie Moreau</strong></h2>



<p>By Dax Kellie, Data Analyst</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/02/corrie-1.jpg" alt="&quot;&quot;" class="wp-image-46369" width="442" height="507" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/02/corrie-1.jpg 312w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/02/corrie-1-261x300.jpg 261w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /><figcaption><meta charset="utf-8">Photo: Cornell University</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Dr Corrie Moreau is a Professor at Cornell University and the Director &amp; Curator of the Cornell University Insect Collection. She loves ants. She researches them and the symbiotic diversity of bacteria in their guts to understand broad evolutionary patterns of life.</p>



<p>Over her PhD, Dr Moreau ambitiously undertook a massive project to use DNA sequencing to construct a family tree of all the major groups of ants in the world. Impressively, she did this work independently of several leading experts (who had just been funded millions of dollars to do the same) after she had asked permission to try to decode a small chunk of the tree and they turned her down. It was a gutsy move for a PhD candidate to take on a project that was eventually compared directly to that of leading experts, but when the two final phylogenies were compared, they “matched almost perfectly”! (quote from E. O. Wilson’s <em>Letters to a Young Scientist</em>)</p>



<p>I was lucky enough to meet Dr Moreau when she gave an invited talk at UNSW, Sydney early on in my PhD. At the time, I had no idea who she was. I had just joined my centre’s social committee, and so I was responsible for organising events and attending to invitees. My own research had nothing to do with ants, gut bacteria, or phylogenomics. Yet Corrie was an enigmatic speaker and a friendly presence. She was especially warm to students and gave some of the best advice I have received to this day on how to advocate and support gender and cultural diversity in STEM. Importantly, she showed me that you don’t have to be a stereotypical academic scientist to succeed – one can still be exceptional while being fun, supportive, and very much themselves.</p>



<p>Edward O. Wilson, Corrie’s PhD supervisor explains Corrie’s disposition perfectly in his book <em>Letters to a Young Scientist</em>:</p>



<p>“There was no bravado in Corrie, no trace of overweening pride, no pretension. She was a quiet, serene enthusiast. As it turned out, she was also an open, helpful friend to fellow students and others around her.”</p>



<p>Hilariously, I was reading this book when I met Corrie and told her about this amazing PhD student in the book who independently created a phylogeny of all the ants…not realising it was her!</p>

<h2 id="elinor-ostrom"><strong>Elinor Ostrom</strong></h2>



<p>By Peggy Newman, Team Lead &amp; Data Manager</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2022/02/ostrom-15149-portrait-mini-2x-1.jpeg" alt="&quot;&quot;" class="wp-image-46367" width="436" height="656"/><figcaption><meta charset="utf-8">Photo: U. Montan, source: The Nobel Foundation</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>My current STEM hero is Elinor Ostrom, the only woman to have ever won a Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. I’m fascinated that her research delved into solutions for the “tragedy of the commons,” and found that there are ways communities can&nbsp;successfully care&nbsp;for common property like land and natural resources without exploiting&nbsp;and destroying&nbsp;them. She found a happy medium between privatisation and state&nbsp;regulation&nbsp;to effectively and efficiently manage natural resources, whereby the community that uses the resource manages it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m extremely moved by her work&nbsp;because the popular discourse of blaming our current environmental and social problems on human greed tends to point fingers at individuals without&nbsp;examining the systems that enable the problems. Through real examples, Ostrom’s work&nbsp;examines how those systems can work better through community governance. Coming from a family of primary producers who rely heavily on environmental resources, I am unbelievably excited about this.

<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#f2f2f2"><em>In an Australian first, our national research infrastructures are creating a new digital atlas to allow researchers to easily discover and work with genomic data.</em></p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>To consolidate Australia’s genomic data and make it available for researchers to use, the Atlas of Living Australia, Bioplatforms Australia, Australian BioCommons and Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) funded via the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) are collaborating on <strong>ARGA, the Australian Reference Genome Atlas</strong>.<br><br>The new genomic atlas will mean that researchers can easily discover and access genomic data for Australian species in one place.</p>

<p>Genomic data – the genome and DNA data of an organism – helps us to understand the core traits of&nbsp;species. It helps us work out why some species are more&nbsp;resilient and adaptive to&nbsp;environmental changes&nbsp;such as&nbsp;climate change, drought and&nbsp;bushfire.​<br><br>Information about how species respond to these pressures is critical to biodiversity research and agriculture. For example, genomic data is used in agriculture to develop crop and livestock species that are more resilient and better adapted to drought and climate change. In ecology, researchers use genomics to identify species for captive breeding programs and&nbsp;repopulation planting that are more likely to recover after significant environmental change, such as that caused by bushfires.</p>

<h2 id="australian-genomic-data"><strong>Australian genomic data</strong></h2>



<p>Australia is home to a large number of native species, including 157,000 animals, plants and fungi, many of which are unique to the continent.​<br><br>With the growth of DNA sequencing capabilities, Australian researchers in universities, research organisations, as well as museums &amp; herbaria have generated huge amounts of genomic data.<br><br>There is huge appetite to delve into the data and find out what genomic secrets our native species hold. Genomic data science is a fast growing and exciting field of science, and researchers need simple and rapid access to genomic data.<br><br>At the moment Australia’s genomic data for our flora, fauna and fungi species resides across numerous international data repositories, museums or research labs, making it difficult to find, access and compare genomic data on Australian species. Some genomics databases were generated and stored using old technology and the data is no longer accessible.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 id="a-national-atlas-for-australian-genomic-data"><strong>A national atlas for Australian genomic data</strong></h2>



<p>The Australian Reference Genome Atlas will locate and aggregate descriptions of all relevant genomic data specific to Australian taxa in one place (e.g. genome assemblies, genome annotations, barcodes, raw data, other ‘omic’ data).</p>



<p>It will enable scientists to search these data by organism. For example, by taxonomic group (e.g. genus, species, subspecies), as well as by functional classification (e.g. drought/salt/fire tolerance, conservation status), and by geographical classification (e.g. location, altitude).<br><br>ARGA will facilitate comparative analysis of genomic data. Researchers will be able to download data for offline analysis, or analyse data in cloud platforms.</p>

<p>This month the <a href="https://australian.museum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Australian Museum</a> celebrated 10 years of <a href="https://volunteer.ala.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DigiVol</a>, the online volunteering platform connecting citizen scientists with the museums and collections around the world since 2011. The Atlas of Living Australia has been a proud partner of DigiVol since the very beginning.</p>



<p>Since 2011, nearly 9 million transcriptions in total have taken place – including museum labels, archival documents, and camera trap projects. Of these, over 1 million were specimen label transcriptions.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-7.png" alt="insect specimens with handwritten labels; handwritten field notes" class="wp-image-46074" width="994" height="559" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-7.png 800w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-7-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-7-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" /><figcaption><em>Left: Insect specimens, Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC). Right: Field notes on DigiVol.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<div style="height:9px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Invaluable information is stored within natural history museum specimens and objects, on their labels and in their archival records. Prior to digitisation this information was accessible only to researchers who could visit the collections&#8217; physical location. By creating a digital record of each item, we are giving access to a global audience,” said Paul Flemons, Manager of Digital Collections and Citizen Science at the Australian Museum, at the DigiVol 10<sup>th</sup> birthday event.</p></blockquote>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>After volunteers complete a task – transcribe a label or identify an animal in an image ­– it is made available on the Atlas of Living Australia and the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)</a> so that researchers worldwide have free and open access to the records. This is a significant contribution to collection digitisation program and biodiversity knowledge in Australia.</p>



<div style="height:9px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The most serious threat to biodiversity is climate change and habitat loss. Discovering and documenting our diverse lands and fauna are crucial first steps to ensuring their survival for future generations,” said Kim McKay AO, Director and CEO of the Australian Museum.</p></blockquote>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>DigiVol is at the heart of the Museum’s 10-year Collection Enhancement Project, working to create digital records for all specimens and objects in the collection, including barcoding and 3D imagery for high-value objects. But DigiVol volunteers don’t only work on the Australian Museum’s collections; over 70 institutions worldwide have made DigiVol part of their digitization effort, including the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/collections/anic" target="_blank">Australian National Insect Collection</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.kew.org/" target="_blank">Kew Gardens</a> and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mcz.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University, Museum of Comparative Zoology</a>.</p>



<div style="height:28px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>DigiVol’s two-stage digitisation process is what makes it so unique, successful, and accessible.</p>



<p>The first stage of the process is carried out on-site at the Australian Museum in Sydney. During this time, specimens in the collection are carefully photographed by a team of volunteers and added to the digital library.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-9-1024x640.png" alt="volunteer at a computer photographing a specimen" class="wp-image-46081" width="984" height="616" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-9-1024x640.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-9-300x188.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-9-768x480.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-9-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-9.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /><figcaption><em>Volunteer working to digitise a specimen in the DigiVol lab in Sydney. Image: Rhiannon Stephens, Australian Museum.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The second stage of the process involves online volunteers from all over the globe working to transcribe specimen labels and other text-based information captured in images.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png" alt="butterfly next to a handwritten label " class="wp-image-46069" width="987" height="658" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png 468w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/image-3-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px" /><figcaption><em>Specimen with handwritten label on DigiVol</em>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the name suggests, the key to DigiVol’s success is the volunteers – both in the lab and online. In fact, in 2015 DigiVol was awarded the NSW Volunteer of the Year Award for ‘Excellence in Volunteer Management (Centre for Volunteering), as well as the Engagement Programs Award (Museum and Galleries NSW). There have been 280 on-site volunteers working on DigiVol over the last 10 years, 40 of whom have been contributing for over five years. Some have even gone on to work for the Museum in a professional capacity. &nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:9px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We congratulate and thank our dedicated DigiVol volunteers and staff on the remarkable achievements of this globally-recognised project. Their efforts have tangible benefits for our institutions and industry as well as being incorporated into decision-making processes and conservation planning,” said Ms McKay.</p></blockquote>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Online, there are currently over 10,500 volunteers and growing – in 2021 over 60,000 volunteer hours were committed to digitization and research!</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>As part of a long term collaboration between the Ngukurr Yangbala Rangers, members of Ngukurr and Numbulwar communities (south east Arnhem Land) and Macquarie University ecologists, we sought to better understand the biocultural knowledge of freshwater turtles, locally known as <em>freshwoda teduls, </em>in the South East Arnhem Land Indigenous Protected Area (SEAL IPA). Human Research Ethics approval was grant by Macquarie University and free, prior informed consent was given by knowledge holders to publish this research.</p>



<p>In 2018 and 2019, the team visited a total of 74 Indigenous Knowledge Holders in their homes (Ngukurr or Numbulwar) or took them out to billabongs. We conducted a series of mapping workshops and interviews to record local knowledge of the distribution, ecology, cultural significance and threats to <em>freshwoda teduls</em>.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Nowadays, people believe that there’s hardly anything [<em>teduls</em>] now… in the billabong, because of pigs and buffalos.

<p>When we looked in the ALA for freshwater turtle species records there were only 12 in the SEAL IPA. To fill this knowledge gap, we mapped local Indigenous Knowledge Holder sightings of past <em>freshwoda teduls</em> and negotiated with the ALA to contribute this dataset to the national ALA species knowledge database. This was the first time Indigenous knowledge from the living memories of Indigenous Knowledge Holders was added to the ALA database alongside scientific species recordings.</p>

<h3 id="adding-indigenous-knowledge-holder-sightings-of-freshwoda-teduls-to-the-ala"><strong>Adding Indigenous Knowledge Holder sightings of <em>freshwoda teduls</em> to the ALA</strong></h3>



<p>Indigenous knowledge holders identified three different <em>freshwoda</em> <em>tedul</em> “types” that occurred<span class="has-inline-color has-black-color"> in the SEAL IPA:</span></p>



<ul><li><em>longnek tedul </em>(Northern long-neck turtle, <em>Chelodina rugosa</em>)</li><li><em>jinggijinggi tedul</em> (Cann’s long-neck turtle, <em>Chelodina canni</em>) and</li><li><em>shotnek tedul</em> (Northern Snapping Turtle, <em>Elseya dentata </em>andWorrell’s Short-Necked Turtle,<em> Emydura subglobosa</em> <em>worrelli</em>)</li></ul>



<p>The <em>longnek tedul</em> (436) was the most common species recorded followed by <em>shotnek tedul</em> (258) and <em>jinggijinggi tedul</em> (59). Most (695) occurrence points were inside the SEAL IPA; however, some (58) fell outside the SEAL IPA boundary (see Figure below). This knowledge greatly expanded the ALA freshwater turtle records for the SEAL IPA as previously there were only 12 (<em>C. rugosa </em>n = 10and <em>E. dentata </em>n = 2). The project added 753 records to the ALA: <em>Longnek tedul</em> (<em>Chelodina oblonga</em>; 436), <em>jinggijinggitedul</em> (<em>Chelodina canni</em>; 59) and <em>shotnek tedul</em> (<em>Elseya dentata, Emydura subglobosa</em>; 258).</p>

<p>Knowledge holders contributed rich biocultural knowledge of <em>freshwoda</em> <em>teduls.</em> </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“All over you get <em>longnek</em> and <em>shotnek</em> together, except on the floodplain you get all <em>longnek</em>.”Numbulwar Numbirindi Ranger Adam Manggurra, stated that the <em>jinggijinggi tedul</em> was present only in freshwater.&#8221;</p><cite>Ngandi Elder Heather Ponto (nee Thompson) described different <em>freshwoda</em> <em>tedul</em> habitat preferences.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Knowledge holders described seasonal knowledge and indicators that related to <em>freshwoda</em> <em>tedul</em> hunting, behaviour, diet and physiology, including aestivation, fatness and breeding cycles. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“That cold weather time, when that wind blows cold, that’s the time we know [to hunt for <em>tedul</em>]”.</p><cite>Davis Daniels</cite></blockquote>



<p>People said <em>teduls</em> were fat in the dry (cold) season and in the late dry season in places where the surface water dries up, <em>longnek</em> <em>teduls</em> are called <em>ngangga</em> which describes a period of dormancy (aestivation) where they bury themselves in the mud until the rain comes again. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“In the dry season people hunt for <em>ngangga</em> turtles by poking long sticks (or crowbars) into the dried mud and they listen for a tap sound. “</p><cite>Yangbala Ranger Kiefer Hall</cite></blockquote>

<h3 id="cultural-significance-of-freshwoda-teduls">Cultural significance of <em>freshwoda</em> <em>teduls</em></h3>



<p><em>Freshwoda</em> <em>teduls</em> have widespread cultural significance to Indigenous people of the SEAL IPA. Knowledge holders discussed how <em>freshwoda</em> <em>teduls</em> are intimately woven through people’s cultural lives and ceremonies. Kevin Rogers explained that <em>freshwoda</em> <em>teduls</em> are connected through ceremony and certain people have roles as owners and caretakers according to the kinship system and these roles and responsibilities are maintained through ceremony. He described how all people and things are connected through songlines and how this forms people’s identity:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We got two types of<em> freshwada</em> <em>tedul</em>, one is <em>longnek</em> and one is <em>shotnek</em>. We call that <em>shotnek</em>, <em>wini</em>, and that belongs to us mob. It’s part of our ceremony too, it’s in our songlines and even that <em>longnek tedul</em> belongs to us mob, Cherry’s mob. So they have a story, through our songlines and our ceremony. One is a <em>shotnek</em>… that other one is… <em>Longnek tedul</em>, and he&#8217;s the <em>junggayi</em> (points to Cherry&#8217;s son), they the main caretakers, <em>junggayi</em> we call him. So it’s a responsible name… we maintain that through our ceremonies… it’s still part of us, that’s what makes us who we are. Not only the <em>teduls</em>, the trees, the birds, stones, everything.” </p><cite>Senior Wubuy knowledge holder Galiliwa Nunggarrgalli whose totem is <em>longnek tedul</em>. He is the owner of <em>ḏalmaarrang</em> (<em>longnek tedul</em>) and his hair can be used to attract <em>tedul</em> while hunting.</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If you cut my hair and put it in the billabong, burn it and put it in the billabong, wait for couple of hours, maybe one or two hours…&nbsp; you can see lots of <em>teduls</em> looking at you.” </p></blockquote>



<h3 id="threats-to-freshwoda-teduls"><a><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Threats to <em>freshwoda</em> <em>teduls</em></span></a></h3>



<p>Some people talked about a significant decrease in <em>tedul</em> abundance:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“When we were kids, <em>tedul </em>was everywhere. These days you hardly find [them], even here walking at Roper River [Ngukurr] itself, [we used to] find <em>tedul</em> walking here at night, in town. ”</p><cite>Davis Daniels</cite></blockquote>



<p>Group interviews revealed that the main threats to <em>freshwoda</em> <em>teduls </em>(all species combined) were natural predators (birds of prey (eagles and hawks), crocodiles, goannas and dingoes; n = 19), feral animals (n = 17) and climate change (n = 8). Four groups stated that there were no threats to <em>freshwoda</em> <em>teduls</em> in this region.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="397" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/Threats-to-tedal-populations-1024x397.png" alt="" class="wp-image-46044" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/Threats-to-tedal-populations-1024x397.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/Threats-to-tedal-populations-300x116.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/Threats-to-tedal-populations-768x298.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2021/12/Threats-to-tedal-populations.png 1332w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Number of interview groups that identified a) Threats to <em>feshwoda teduls</em> (n=30) and b) Different feral animals as a threat to <em>feshwoda teduls</em>  in the SEAL IPA (n=30).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of the feral animals, pigs (n=13) were most often mentioned as a threat to <em>freshwoda</em> <em>teduls</em>, followed by feral water buffalo (n=9), horse (n=4), donkey (n=3), cattle (n=3) and cane toads (n=3). As stated by several knowledge holders, pig and buffalo were considered the most damaging feral ungulates as they trample and eat aestivating <em>freshwoda</em> <em>teduls</em>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“They get trampled by the buffalos and pigs… trample all over the billabong.” </p><cite>Cherry Daniels</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>Pigipigi</em> [pigs] too, they eat <em>ḏalmaarrang</em> [aestivating <em>longnek</em> <em>teduls</em>].”</p><cite>Rena Wayayun Guyula</cite></blockquote>



<p>Changes in weather patterns were highlighted by Ngandi senior knowledge holder Hubert Rami as a threat to <em>freshwater</em> <em>tedul </em>populations:</p>



<p>“Hardly had any rain at the moment. Get maybe two, three month’s rain in a year and that’s it. That’s all we get… <em>teduls </em>are dying maybe because of less rain. Because they live in [the] water all the time, water creatures. If there is no water, then everything dies. The <em>tedul </em>stays in the mud [aestivating]. Mud gets hard with no rain, then how the <em>tedul </em>going to get out?”</p>



<p>The timing of pig invasion in south east Arnhem Land is estimated to be around the 1990s, which aligned with group interview discussions regarding timing of changes to Country, <em>freshwoda</em> <em>tedul </em>abundance and traditional hunting practices.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Feral animals now, like when them pigs and buffalo walk on the wet soil, they leave them marks you know. New millennium. Everything been just change. Destruction of the land, hunting place.”</p><cite> <span style="font-size: revert; color: currentcolor;">Kara Daniels</span> </cite></blockquote>



<h3 id="new-data-in-the-ala-personal-memories-of-species-observations"><strong>New data in the ALA: personal memories of species observations</strong></h3>



<p>This was the first time Indigenous accounts of species occurrences were contributed as data points to the Atlas of Living Australia. With the consent of Indigenous Holders, Indigenous knowledge such as this has the potential to contribute valuable information to national databases, especially for culturally significant species that people have strong connections with. Although we’ve added hundreds of data points from Indigenous people’s memory of turtle hunting in their lifetimes, the accompanying biocultural knowledge shared by knowledge holders reinforces the global conservation concern of freshwater turtle decline.</p>

<p>Australia faces a range of challenges in how best to monitor and manage its unique and challenging environment. In this context, projects to collate and store environmental data, or convert that data to information that can inform decision-making, are critical to ensure improved outcomes for our land, water and biodiversity. However, the technological infrastructure that delivers those benefits, and the novel innovations that power them, are often overlooked. Join us to hear from three speakers working to convert computational innovation into real outcomes for researchers &amp; decision-makers and find out more about where eInfrastructure is heading next.</p>
