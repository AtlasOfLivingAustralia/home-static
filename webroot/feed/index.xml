					<description><![CDATA[ALA’s new book – Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Why did we publish this book?</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p>Tidying messy data can be difficult, but it is a task that anybody who works with data must face if they want to use data to tackle scientific questions!</p>



<p>The Atlas of Living Australia&#8217;s (ALA) Science &amp; Decision Team recently authored a book titled <a href="https://cleaning-data-r.ala.org.au/">Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</a>. This free resource provides up-to-date information on data cleaning processes for anybody who handles their data using code in R. As Australia’s national biodiversity database, the ALA is frequently asked questions about the best way to clean data using code.  To provide advice on this topic, our first step was to investigate what the currently accepted “best” way might be. We deep-dived into multiple recent peer-reviewed research to see whether experts cleaned their biodiversity data in the same way.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://edit.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2024/08/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-712x1024.png" alt="cover of the data cleaning book, with dark blue background and an orange crustacean" class="wp-image-49700" style="width:312px;height:auto"/></figure></div></div>
</div>



<p>Through this process we discovered that the steps to clean ecological data can be really messy! Even among experts, data cleaning can look completely different depending on the type of investigation and study species. No wonder people ask how to do it!</p>



<p>This book is our response to questions about how to clean biodiversity data in R. The book provides guidance on many of the processes for cleaning biodiversity data.</p>

<p><strong>What’s covered in the book and who is it for?</strong></p>



<p>In <em>Cleaning Biodiversity Data in R</em>, we provide an overview of a typical biodiversity data cleaning workflow for open-access geo-referenced biodiversity data—from acquisition, to error identification, to correction. These processes are broken down into sections on exploring data, general data cleaning, and data cleaning processes that require expertise in your study species. The book has information suited to those just starting out working with biodiversity using R, to those who are looking for more advanced techniques.</p>

<p>We hope that&nbsp;<a href="https://cleaning-data-r.ala.org.au/">this resource</a> can help support your data cleaning tasks in the future, and act as a useful learning or reference tool for teaching and sharing knowledge around data cleaning.</p>

<p>Did you know that small bodies of water in Australia&#8217;s cities, like ponds or retention basins, play a crucial role in the environment? These urban wetlands are vital for supporting clean water, healthy ecosystems, and even bird migration. However, urban wetlands are often highly modified or constructed bodies of water, and are therefore seen as less “valuable” from an urban planning lens in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem outcomes. </p>



<p>In a partnership between the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), the&nbsp;<a href="https://aurin.org.au/">Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">BirdLife Australia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://federation.edu.au/">Federation University</a>, a tool was created to raise awareness of the importance of wetlands in urban environments. The team used open-source citizen-science data to quantify the values of urban wetlands across Victoria, including those that have previously been overlooked. This information was collated into a publicly available online mapping tool, ‘<ins><a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/">Valuing Urban Wetlands</a></ins>’.</p>



<p><strong>The online tool</strong></p>



<p>The tool integrates waterbird and landscape data through an online portal called ‘<a href="https://www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au/"><em>Valuing Urban Wetlands</em></a><em>.</em>’ Waterbird data collected through citizen science and professional science was accessed via the ALA,&nbsp;<a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">BirdLife Australia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ebird.org/region/AU">eBird</a>&nbsp;and overlayed with open landscape data to create metrics for assessing wetland health and importance. The tool focuses on the Greater Melbourne region, but the methodology can be applied to other regions in the future</p>

<p>As a mega-diverse continent, Australia&#8217;s home to hundreds of thousands of species, with more being discovered every year. Despite this, Australia faces one of the highest species extinction rates, meaning that innovative methods to detect and understand our biodiversity are becoming increasingly important.</p>



<p>Advancing technologies like genomics, advanced imaging and machine learning are changing the way that researchers and policymakers respond to climate risks, species conservation and protection, biosecurity and decision-making.</p>



<p>In this webinar hosted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://ala.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b238aea31bbd4bd103ff7368c&amp;id=43167d8001&amp;e=3629824322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlas of Living Australia,</a>&nbsp;hear from three of our partners to explore how they’ve applied next-generation technology to support Australian biodiversity research.</p>



<p>The ALA receives support from the Australian Government through the <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/ncris">National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy</a> (NCRIS) and is hosted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>.</p>
