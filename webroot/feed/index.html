					<description><![CDATA[Today we release our Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) strategy has been shaped extensively by input from our national and international partners who contributed so actively to our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png" alt="Image of the cover for the ALA Strategy 2020-2025" class="wp-image-44115" width="232" height="328" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png 603w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image-213x300.png 213w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf">Download the Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As Australia’s national biodiversity data infrastructure and one of the world’s foremost such capabilities, we rely on the strength of our partnerships with data providers, users and stakeholders. Indeed, the genesis of the ALA was built on the strength and richness of existing relationships within the museums, collections and herbaria communities. </p>



<p>Australia’s fruitful partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>) also provides our community a unique opportunity to ensure that local, regional or national biodiversity data delivers impact globally. The ALA is particularly proud of the relationship we play hosting the Australian node of GBIF.</p>



<p>Supported by the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (<a href="https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris">NCRIS</a>), and hosted by <a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>, the ALA website launched 10 years ago. Since those beginnings the ALA has matured from an energetic ‘start-up’ to a stable and reliable data infrastructure delivering world-trusted biodiversity data and related services.</p>



<p>Our strategy builds on this history while identifying where we need to evolve. This includes adapting our infrastructure to deal with an increase in volume and variety of data, improving how we deal with data quality in a federated system, delivering more comprehensive and representative national data holdings, and partnering with new sectors.</p>



<p>We welcome&nbsp;further conversations with our partners to identify&nbsp;possible alignment opportunities framed around our strategy.</p>



<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a> if you would like more information or if you have any questions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the winter edition of our ALA newsletter. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear ALA community,</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44152" width="162" height="162" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png 300w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px" /></figure></div>



<p>We lead off this issue with the release of the ALA Strategy 2020-2025 which has been developed in response to the findings from our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process. Our communities’ feedback regarding what’s worked well and where the ALA needs to head to continue to remain relevant was instrumental in shaping the strategy and we are grateful for those contributions. Our strategy has also been informed by what our team understands needs to evolve to future-proof the ALA, for example with regard to the anticipated increase in the variety and volume of data we receive annually from our partners.</p>



<p>In response to our strategy we’ve already commenced both an architectural upgrade to our infrastructure, and the ALA data quality project both of which are described in further detail on our <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/current-projects/">projects pages</a>. These projects go to the core of our first two strategic objectives around delivering <em>trusted data</em> and provision of <em>robust services</em>. In addition to steering the ALA&#8217;s work program we see the strategy as an opportunity for our partners to identify points of engagement or alignment, and in coming months we’ll provide you greater clarity around our project roadmap.</p>



<p>In response to the summer bushfire crisis, ALA on behalf of CSIRO led a national coordination process bringing together the citizen science and research sectors to explore how best to support ongoing response and preparedness activities.&nbsp; This activity resulted in the publication of a <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Environment/Extreme-Events/Bushfire/Citizen-Science/Citizen-Science-Bushfire-Forums">recommendations report</a> which explores how to establish a national approach for ongoing citizen science and traditional science engagement. CSIRO have now appointed a program lead to further progress this work. Erin Roger, based with the ALA, will design and lead a program of work to engender greater coordination between both sectors with the aim of&nbsp; better supporting current recovery, and future preparedness activities as we approach the coming summer. We are pleased to be working so closely with CSIRO’s bushfire and recovery program.</p>



<p>And finally, in this issue we showcase three contemporary Australian research publications that leverage the capability of the ALA to further our understanding of climate impacts on eucalypts and coral, the long-term shifts in the distribution of plant species that provide critical habitat for Koalas, and evaluating low-cost techniques for monitoring pollinators in open and wooded habitats. For our data partners and our team its always rewarding to see how our collective efforts enable such important science.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy the winter edition of our newsletter.</p>



<p>Kind regards,</p>



<p>Andre Zerger</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’re starting a review of our environmental and contextual layers to improve user experience and system performance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="305" height="259" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44145" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png 305w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1-300x255.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></figure></div>



<h3 id="spatial-information-in-the-ala"><strong>Spatial information in the ALA</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://regions.ala.org.au/">https://regions.ala.org.au/https://regions.ala.org.au/</a>Spatial information is a big part of what we do at the ALA. To enable thorough spatial analysis for our users, we sample each and every occurrence record from our data providers against several hundred spatial layers. This means that when you’re searching for species in the ALA, you can search by a particular area (for example, by the state of Victoria, or by a national park – we call these&nbsp;<em>contextual spatial layers</em>) or by a particular&nbsp;<em>environmental</em>&nbsp;condition, like climate, or vegetative cover. All layers can be visualised through our Spatial Portal, and some of them through our regions tool (<a href="https://regions.ala.org.au/">http://regions.ala.org.au/</a>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png" alt="Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers page in the ALA." class="wp-image-44146" width="538" height="369" srcset="https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png 734w, https://www-test.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers web page in the ALA.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="time-for-an-update"><strong>Time for an update</strong></h3>



<p>To ensure we continue to provide a national representative collection of environmental and contextual layers for analysis, we will be undertaking a review, update and consolidation of spatial layers that are provided within ALA services. This review will take into consideration:</p>



<h4 id="how-often-layers-are-used">How often layers are used</h4>



<p>We’ve found that many layers are not used very often at all. Our stats tell us there’s a long-tail distribution of usage whereby 80% of layers are used less than 5% of the layer of maximum usage, and 40% are used less than 1% of the layer of maximum usage.</p>



<h4 id="our-system-performance">Our system performance</h4>



<p>Supporting and maintaining digital infrastructure to index and query hundreds of layers is particularly challenging and impose significant resource constraints.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-still-current-and-relevant">Whether layers are still current and relevant</h4>



<p>Some layers or suites of layers have been superseded, upgraded or are highly correlated with other layers.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-available-elsewhere">Whether layers are available elsewhere</h4>



<p>We needed to examine the ALA’s position in light of other related portals, such as the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (<a href="https://bccvl.org.au/">BCCVL</a>). The BCCVL is better suited to provide the multitude of climate model projections, and IMOS’ Australian Ocean Data Network portal (<a href="https://portal.aodn.org.au/">AODN</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://imos.org.au/">IMOS</a>) is better suited to provide oceanographic layers.</p>



<p>Our challenge is to provide a good representative sample of both environmental and contextual layers relevant to biodiversity data analysis, but we want to avoid being overly specialised.</p>



<h3 id="whats-next"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>



<p>Over the coming months we’ll be working on updating and rationalising our layer holdings. This review will be repeated annually. </p>



<h3 id="more-information"><strong>More information</strong></h3>



<p>More comprehensive information and technical detail about this process is provided in our Knowledge Base article ALA&nbsp;<a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000237045-what-are-environmental-and-contextual-spatial-layers-">Environmental and Contextual Spatial Layers</a>, including our criteria for review.</p>



<p>As usual, if you have any questions or comments, please let us know at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a>.</p>
