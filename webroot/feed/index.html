<p>The ALA brings together occurrence record data, taxonomic information, spatial and historical information on species distributions, and environmental data. These data are central to the research areas of ecology, conservation, environmental planning, Indigenous ecological management and sustainability.</p>



<p>The ALA’s contribution to the research output in these fields is has steadily increased over the last 10 years and now over 2,300 scientific publications have referenced the ALA, providing novel contributions to a range of fields.</p>



<p>For example, researchers have used data from ALA to show changes in Platypus numbers over the last 150 years (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00720</a>); identify rare species that thrive in Australian towns and cities (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2032</a>); and understand complex migration behaviour in insects that would otherwise go undetected (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12856</a>). Images stored by the ALA have even been used to build apps that can automatically identify Australian insects in the field (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2019.8803746">https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2019.8803746</a>).</p>



<p>As our data holdings continue to grow, researchers are identifying new ways to draw on ALA in their research to better understand Australia’s unique biodiversity.</p>



<p>You can now search and browse publications that reference or cite the ALA on our new webpage <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/ala-cited-publications/">ALA-cited publications</a>.</p>



<p>If you are a researcher and use the ALA to access data or analytical tools, read <a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000195866-how-to-cite-the-ala">How to cite the ALA</a> for more detail on best practices for citing and acknowledging the ALA.</p>



<p><strong>Ten years of the ALA</strong></p>



<p>Ten years ago, Australian national collections, science organisations, and government agencies saw the opportunity for a national online and open data repository for biodiversity data. The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) was established with funding from the Australian Government’s National Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) to fulfill this role and aggregate Australia’s biodiversity data.</p>



<p>“The ALA has changed the way biodiversity research and environmental decision making occurs in Australia,” said ALA Director Dr Andre Zerger.</p>



<p>“We now have over 90 million occurrence records and function as the most comprehensive dataset on Australian biodiversity. The ALA has over 78,000 registered users and access to 700 datasets from data partners across research, government and citizen science.”</p>



<p><strong>Built on partnerships</strong></p>



<p>Central to the success of the ALA are the contributions from our data partners. They are the backbone of the ALA, providing authoritative data for species names and classification, geospatial reference data, environmental layers, and species occurrence data. These datasets all contribute to the rich tapestries of data that are accessible via the ALA, and enable the ALA to perform like a window into the complex world of biodiversity science.</p>



<p>“The work of the organisations and institutions that provide data, and manage, curate and update that data, underpins our success and we look forward to continuing and growing these partnerships over another ten years,” said Andre.</p>



<p><strong>National and global reach</strong></p>



<p>The ALA not only delivers Australia’s biodiversity data at a national level, it also contributes to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world&#8217;s governments to provide open access to data about all types of life on Earth.</p>



<p>The ALA is the Australian node of GBIF and has significantly contributed to this global network for open biodiversity data access.</p>



<p>“Through the GBIF living atlases community, the infrastructure our team first developed 10 years ago is now being used by 27 countries around the world to manage their biodiversity data,” said Andre.</p>

<p>On board, Thomas assisted scientists with marine research; enhanced his STEM content knowledge; ran outreach activities, including live video broadcasts; and developed curriculum-linked resources for his own classroom and to share with other teachers.</p>



<p>Prior to his voyage, Thomas attended a variety of training and planning activities, including an Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) online workshop. The ALA workshop explained how to find information on the species he might observe on his voyage, and provided a working knowledge of the ALA’s analysis tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A requirement for teachers participating in the Educator on Board program was to&nbsp;develop curriculum-linked lesson plans and resources based on the research and/or ship operations.</p>

<p>Thomas incorporated the use of the ALA in his Year 7 Science resource <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Education/Teachers/Educator-on-Board/Teacher-Developed-Resources/Taxonomic-Identification"><em>Taxonomic classification and species data collection</em></a>.</p>



<p>The three-part lesson sequence features real voyage data collected during Thomas’ trip on RV <em>Investigator.</em> In the lesson, students learn about seabird species in different regions and compare the collected data to environmental overlays provided by the ALA. Layers of environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall or humidity are used to show the conditions favoured by particular species.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today we release our Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025.  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) strategy has been shaped extensively by input from our national and international partners who contributed so actively to our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png" alt="Image of the cover for the ALA Strategy 2020-2025" class="wp-image-44115" width="232" height="328" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image.png 603w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-cover-page-image-213x300.png 213w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf">Download the Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As Australia’s national biodiversity data infrastructure and one of the world’s foremost such capabilities, we rely on the strength of our partnerships with data providers, users and stakeholders. Indeed, the genesis of the ALA was built on the strength and richness of existing relationships within the museums, collections and herbaria communities. </p>



<p>Australia’s fruitful partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a>) also provides our community a unique opportunity to ensure that local, regional or national biodiversity data delivers impact globally. The ALA is particularly proud of the relationship we play hosting the Australian node of GBIF.</p>



<p>Supported by the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (<a href="https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris">NCRIS</a>), and hosted by <a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>, the ALA website launched 10 years ago. Since those beginnings the ALA has matured from an energetic ‘start-up’ to a stable and reliable data infrastructure delivering world-trusted biodiversity data and related services.</p>



<p>Our strategy builds on this history while identifying where we need to evolve. This includes adapting our infrastructure to deal with an increase in volume and variety of data, improving how we deal with data quality in a federated system, delivering more comprehensive and representative national data holdings, and partnering with new sectors.</p>



<p>We welcome&nbsp;further conversations with our partners to identify&nbsp;possible alignment opportunities framed around our strategy.</p>



<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ala.org.au">support@ala.org.au</a> if you would like more information or if you have any questions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the winter edition of our ALA newsletter. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear ALA community,</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44152" width="162" height="162" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px" /></figure></div>



<p>We lead off this issue with the release of the ALA Strategy 2020-2025 which has been developed in response to the findings from our 2019 <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report/">ALA Future Directions</a> national consultation process. Our communities’ feedback regarding what’s worked well and where the ALA needs to head to continue to remain relevant was instrumental in shaping the strategy and we are grateful for those contributions. Our strategy has also been informed by what our team understands needs to evolve to future-proof the ALA, for example with regard to the anticipated increase in the variety and volume of data we receive annually from our partners.</p>



<p>In response to our strategy we’ve already commenced both an architectural upgrade to our infrastructure, and the ALA data quality project both of which are described in further detail on our <a href="https://www.ala.org.au/current-projects/">projects pages</a>. These projects go to the core of our first two strategic objectives around delivering <em>trusted data</em> and provision of <em>robust services</em>. In addition to steering the ALA&#8217;s work program we see the strategy as an opportunity for our partners to identify points of engagement or alignment, and in coming months we’ll provide you greater clarity around our project roadmap.</p>



<p>In response to the summer bushfire crisis, ALA on behalf of CSIRO led a national coordination process bringing together the citizen science and research sectors to explore how best to support ongoing response and preparedness activities.&nbsp; This activity resulted in the publication of a <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Environment/Extreme-Events/Bushfire/Citizen-Science/Citizen-Science-Bushfire-Forums">recommendations report</a> which explores how to establish a national approach for ongoing citizen science and traditional science engagement. CSIRO have now appointed a program lead to further progress this work. Erin Roger, based with the ALA, will design and lead a program of work to engender greater coordination between both sectors with the aim of&nbsp; better supporting current recovery, and future preparedness activities as we approach the coming summer. We are pleased to be working so closely with CSIRO’s bushfire and recovery program.</p>



<p>And finally, in this issue we showcase three contemporary Australian research publications that leverage the capability of the ALA to further our understanding of climate impacts on eucalypts and coral, the long-term shifts in the distribution of plant species that provide critical habitat for Koalas, and evaluating low-cost techniques for monitoring pollinators in open and wooded habitats. For our data partners and our team its always rewarding to see how our collective efforts enable such important science.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy the winter edition of our newsletter.</p>



<p>Kind regards,</p>



<p>Andre Zerger</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’re starting a review of our environmental and contextual layers to improve user experience and system performance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="305" height="259" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44145" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png 305w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1-300x255.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></figure></div>



<h3 id="spatial-information-in-the-ala"><strong>Spatial information in the ALA</strong></h3>



<p>Spatial information is a big part of what we do at the ALA. To enable thorough spatial analysis for our users, we sample each and every occurrence record from our data providers against several hundred spatial layers. This means that when you’re searching for species in the ALA, you can search by a particular area (for example, by the state of Victoria, or by a national park – we call these&nbsp;<em>contextual spatial layers</em>) or by a particular&nbsp;<em>environmental</em>&nbsp;condition, like climate, or vegetative cover. All layers can be visualised through our Spatial Portal, and some of them through our regions tool (<a href="https://regions.ala.org.au/">http://regions.ala.org.au/</a>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png" alt="Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers page in the ALA." class="wp-image-44146" width="538" height="369" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page.png 734w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/Spatial-layers-web-page-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the Available Spatial Layers web page in the ALA.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="time-for-an-update"><strong>Time for an update</strong></h3>



<p>To ensure we continue to provide a national representative collection of environmental and contextual layers for analysis, we will be undertaking a review, update and consolidation of spatial layers that are provided within ALA services. This review will take into consideration:</p>



<h4 id="how-often-layers-are-used">How often layers are used</h4>



<p>We’ve found that many layers are not used very often at all in the Spatial Portal. Our stats tell us there’s a long-tail distribution of usage whereby 80% of layers are used less than 5% of the layer of maximum usage, and 40% are used less than 1% of the layer of maximum usage.</p>



<h4 id="our-system-performance">Our system performance</h4>



<p>Supporting and maintaining digital infrastructure to index and query hundreds of layers is particularly challenging and impose significant resource constraints.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-still-current-and-relevant">Whether layers are still current and relevant</h4>



<p>Some layers or suites of layers have been superseded, upgraded or are highly correlated with other layers.</p>



<h4 id="whether-layers-are-available-elsewhere">Whether layers are available elsewhere</h4>



<p>We needed to examine the ALA’s position in light of other related portals, such as the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (<a href="https://bccvl.org.au/">BCCVL</a>). The BCCVL is better suited to provide the multitude of climate model projections, and IMOS’ Australian Ocean Data Network portal (<a href="https://portal.aodn.org.au/">AODN</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://imos.org.au/">IMOS</a>) is better suited to provide oceanographic layers.</p>



<p>Our challenge is to provide a good representative sample of both environmental and contextual layers relevant to biodiversity data analysis, but we want to avoid being overly specialised.</p>



<h3 id="whats-next"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>



<p>Over the coming months we’ll be working on updating and rationalising our layer holdings. This review will be repeated annually. </p>



<h3 id="more-information"><strong>More information</strong></h3>



<p>More comprehensive information and technical detail about this process is provided in our Knowledge Base article ALA&nbsp;<a href="https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000237045-what-are-environmental-and-contextual-spatial-layers-">Environmental and Contextual Spatial Layers</a>, including our criteria for review.</p>

<p>The ALA Data Quality project team is working hard to complete and release its first piece of software. But there&#8217;s still time to test and provide feedback.</p>



<p>Since the Data Quality Project launched in February, the team has been working with the ALA user community to identify data quality issues and develop solutions.  Thank you to everyone who has completed our surveys, contributed to baseline perceptions of data quality, helped to prioritise issues, or tested solutions so far. </p>



<p><strong> First proposed software release – improvements to data filters</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to issues identified in our data quality survey (see below), the project team are developing a new capability to pre-filter search results. This means lower quality records will not be shown unless they are actively included. </p>



<p>The new software will enable users to switch filters&nbsp;on&nbsp;or&nbsp;off&nbsp;and manage&nbsp;them&nbsp;as a group or&nbsp;individually. Information&nbsp;is available on the&nbsp;fields and data that make up the filters&nbsp;through mouse-over text and&nbsp;clickable info icons (i).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are still testing the new software and welcome your feedback. </p>



<h4 id="how-to-test-the-software">How to test the software</h4>



<ol><li>Sign in to our ALA <a href="https://biocache-dq-test.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=*%3A*">Test Environment</a>. </li><li>View the filters in the new user interface (UI) element above the search results. </li><li>Interact with the filters, noting how they work for you.</li><li>Email any comments or feedback to <a href="mailto:dataquality@ala.org.au">dataquality@ala.org.au</a>.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="471" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-1024x471.png" alt="" class="wp-image-44128" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-1024x471.png 1024w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-300x138.png 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-768x353.png 768w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1-1536x706.png 1536w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/07/data-quality-filters-1.png 1870w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Screenshot showing results from an occurrence records search. The proposed Data Quality Filters are circled in red.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Priori</strong><strong>ti</strong><strong>sation survey</strong><strong>&nbsp;results</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>After establishing a baseline for perceptions of data quality (<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/data-quality-project-baseline-survey-results/">see results</a>), we conducted a prioritisation survey. This helped to identify which issues the data quality project should address first. The top two issues identified were: </p>



<ul><li>ALA users are using data accessed via the ALA without filtering out records that are not fit for purpose. </li><li>Due to data quality indicators not being present, users are often unsure whether to use particular records or datasets. </li></ul>



<p>For more information on the&nbsp;data quality project please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ala.org.au/data-quality-project/">Data Quality&nbsp;project page</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataquality@ala.org.au">dataquality@ala.org.au</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="caught-on-camera">Caught on camera</h2>



<p>To do this, they launched their project on the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.csiro.au/citizen-science-bushfire-recovery/">Citizen Science Bushfire Project Finder</a>. The website let’s anyone anywhere in the world to play a part in Australia’s bushfire recovery.</p>



<p>A team from the South Australia Department for Environment and Water got to work. They set up over 70 cameras across Kangaroo Island. With these cameras they wanted to capture the remaining species on tape. But this was only the first step.</p>



<p>The team uploaded over 15,000 images captured by these cameras to a virtual expedition. This expedition allows volunteers to help review each image.</p>



<p>“The process of reviewing each photo takes time,” National Parks and Wildlife Service South Australia Conversation and Wildlife Manager Jason Higham said.</p>



<p>“By using the curiosity, expertise and willingness to help that is present in the community, the field team can focus their efforts on feral cat control measures and searching remnant patches for wildlife such as for the Kangaroo Island dunnart.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="954" height="629" src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44092" srcset="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart.jpg 954w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/KI-dunnart-768x506.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" /><figcaption>The Kangaroo Island dunnart. Only found on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. Image credit: Government of South Australia Department for Environment and Water.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="the-kangaroo-island-dunnart-expedition">The Kangaroo Island dunnart expedition</h2>



<p>The Kangaroo Island dunnart is only found on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. It’s critically endangered with a population estimated at 300-500 individuals. This estimate was before the 2019-20 bushfires.</p>



<p>More than 90 per cent of the dunnarts’ habitat was burnt in the bushfires. Therefore there’s been a significant decline in the population. This means it’s more important than ever to track and protect these animals.</p>



<p>In April, we launched the virtual expeditions and Kangaroo Island Dunnart Survey project as part of our Citizen Science Bushfire Project. And with great success.</p>



<p>Volunteers from across Australia joined the expeditions. They reviewed a series of images and a list of possible animals to look out for. Keen-eyes worked out what species were in the images. And once submitted, the team sent the next set of images. Addictive, right?</p>



<p>Within three weeks of launching, the volunteers identified and classified 15,000 images for the dunnart survey. The team were overwhelmed with eager people asking when there would be more images to transcribe.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-now">Where to now?</h2>



<p>With the images classified, the information went to the researchers for analysis. They are incredibly grateful for all the hard work.</p>



<p>Your contribution means the team can focus their time and effort elsewhere. Like controlling predators and searching for the remaining species populations.</p>



<p>The data gathered from the images will:</p>



<ul><li>Help to develop an in-depth understanding of the surviving animal populations. This will inform research into how the native species react to and recover from bushfire conditions.</li><li>Assist with feral predator control. This ensures the remaining animal population is safe from predators when they’re most at risk.</li><li>Generate recovery actions for species like the Kangaroo Island dunnart, little pygmy possum and southern brown bandicoot. As a result of the bushfires, species may be at risk of low population numbers. It’s up to the researchers to come up with a plan to make sure the species can continue to thrive on the island.</li></ul>
