					<description><![CDATA[Hi My name is susan Savage I coordinate a bushcare group in Killarney queensland . I would like to get an update of the basic training as I have found that many of my sightings and photos have been removed after having been accepted earlier last year.
Also Latter this year we are looking forward to running another Biodiversity Weekend in Killarney. This time we expect to be partnering with Condamine Alliance. I would be interested in holding a workshop to train interested citizen scientists as a part of this Weekend. could someone suggest a person who might be able to do this?

Value feedback
