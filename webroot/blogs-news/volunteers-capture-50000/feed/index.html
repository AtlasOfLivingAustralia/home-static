					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Volunteer Portal passes 50,000 tasks The Atlas Volunteer Portal (VP; http://volunteer.ala.org.au/) reached a number of major milestones during 2013. The VP recently saw the completion of the 50,000th transcription task, and it hasn’t stopped there; as of Dec 18 over 59,000 tasks have been transcribed. It also passed the 500 volunteer mark, and the most prolific transcriber, Megan, has completed her 10,000th task. Truly a remarkable effort. Congratulations go to Paul Flemons from the Australian Museum for continuing to drive this remarkable system forward and attract new “expeditions”.
