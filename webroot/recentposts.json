He looked at the increase in the volume of data being uploaded &nbsp;and numbers of users,&nbsp; the different taxonomic and spatial data being recorded, and showcased some applications of iNaturalist data for species conservation and monitoring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201ciNaturalist is an excellent platform for recording observations of species and it has contributed enormously to our biodiversity data holdings in Australia,\u201d said Thomas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great platform to increase public participation in natural science.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data collected by citizen scientists through iNaturalist is made available online through the Atlas of Living Australia and becomes part of the ever-increasing Australian biodiversity data repository. Researchers and people in government working on environment policy use biodiversity data in the ALA to inform many research studies and government programs in ecology, land management, species conservation and biosecurity measures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iNaturalist Australia in numbers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iNaturalist is one of the most popular biodiversity citizen science platforms globally, with more than 1.4 million users having contributed over 54 million observations. Australia contributes the most observations in the southern hemisphere, and is in the top four contributing nations globally. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"949\" height=\"534\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iNat-infographic_2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44638\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iNat-infographic_2.png 949w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iNat-infographic_2-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iNat-infographic_2-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, the ALA collaborated with the global iNaturalist Network to set up iNaturalist Australia.

The data come from a range of sources that are public (primarily ALA) and restricted (jurisdictions, researchers, private). Access to restricted data can be sought, but the process is time consuming, and it\u2019s not always clear who to approach, or how. A key focus for the project will be developing and implementing a National Framework to address issues such as licensing, access and authority, governance and programmatic standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fuzzy wuzzy data<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obscuring or fuzzying threatened species data is a necessary practice to ensure vulnerable species are protected from poachers or habitat destruction and prevent unscrupulous researchers from accessing data. However, there is no nationally standardised way for obscuring precise location data. Each institution is reliant on internal or third party (state conservation agency or the Atlas of Living Australia) to fuzz data. Accidental data releases are an ever-present threat that manifests regularly.

Here are the eggs used in this study.

They used it to reconstruct near-complete mitochondrial genomes, a first using eggshells of non-ratite birds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, a team from ANWC and the Australian National University announced DNA can be extracted from very small eggshells held in museum collections without causing damage to the integrity or appearance of the specimen. The team demonstrated how their new sampling technique can be used to confirm the identity of unknown specimens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the world there are nearly 5 million eggshell specimens held in natural history collections. Many were collected by hobbyists in the past, before egg collecting was made illegal in most countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-1024x1007.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44538\" width=\"309\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-1024x1007.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-300x295.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-768x755.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO.png 1144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" \/><figcaption>Eggs specimens shown before (left) and after (right) drilling to extract DNA for this study.

But bird eggshells often lack metadata because the eggs of different species can look very similar,\u201d said lead author Alicia Grealy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn this study we examined 45 different eggshell specimens from ANWC that lacked metadata. We compared different sampling methods, such as swabbing the surface of eggshells, but ultimately optimised a drilling technique to retrieve eggshell powder. This provided us with sufficient DNA to identify the species while keeping the specimen intact,\u201d Alicia said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team cross-checked the species IDs they generated by using the Atlas of Living Australia to compare the morphology of each egg specimen with published reference photographs of that taxon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe then put the method to the test on a clutch of eggs in ANWC that purportedly were of the extinct Paradise Parrot,\u201d Alicia said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:5cc6c8d2-50dc-4c9f-9b12-5423b6da6f18\">Paradise Parrot (<em>Psephotellus pulcherrimus<\/em><\/a>) was listed as extinct in 1927. It lived in south-east Queensland and laid its nondescript white eggs inside termite mounds. Collected in 1967, the clutch of eggs had been identified as belonging to the Paradise Parrot and this has been contested for more than 50 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Parrots_egg_ANWC-CSIRO.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44528\" width=\"368\" height=\"237\"\/><figcaption>Egg specimens are valuable records of where and when birds have bred in changing environments and can inform how their distributions are changing.
