These tokens are designed to be short-lived and encrypted, ensuring that your credentials remain protected and reducing the potential for unauthorised access or data breaches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"seamless-user-experience\"><strong>Seamless User Experience<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re committed to improving your experience across the ALA site; while this includes features like navigation, readability and look and feel, it also relates to login experience and performance.

This means that you can continue to leverage your existing accounts from trusted identity providers such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/aaf.edu.au\/\">Australian Access Federation<\/a> (AAF), eliminating the need to create another username and password \u2013 making it quicker and easier to access the ALA for existing AAF users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"scalability-and-integration\"><strong>Scalability and Integration<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the number of records in the ALA grows, we ensure that our systems are flexible and scalable. OIDC allows us to integrate with a variety of web applications and evolve alongside other technical advancements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaboration is also a big part of what we do at the ALA, so we can continue to make even more data findable and accessible. With the growing adoption of OIDC, integration is made easier with our data partners and other collaborators. For example, we are working with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tern.org.au\/\">TERN<\/a> to integrate OIDC, making it quicker and easier for our <a href=\"https:\/\/fieldcapture.ala.org.au\/\">MERIT<\/a> users to sign in and submit data to the MERIT system using the TERN Monitor application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summary\">Summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The adoption of OIDC authentication represents a significant milestone in the ALA\u2019s ongoing commitment to data security, performance, and user experience.

They lay bright green eggs, with dads stepping up to be in charge of incubation and chick rearing. Once the eggs hatch, baby cassowaries can walk almost immediately with their strong back legs.

Photo Credit DHFischer CC BY NC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep your distance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll often hear these big birds before you see them! Cassowaries are notorious for communicating through deep rumbles, hisses and grunting sounds. Cassowaries use various vocalisations to communicate through their dense rainforest habitats. If you hear a cassowary calling, make sure you keep your distance. Equipped with a razor-sharp beak, talons and a particularly territorial nature, cassowaries are more than capable of tearing through flesh if they feel threatened. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keystone species<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cassowaries are \u2018keystone species\u2019 &#8211; species which has a disproportionately important role in their natural ecosystems. In rainforest habitats across northern QLD, cassowaries play a critical role in dispersing many native seeds through fragmented rainforest landscapes. Due to their large size, cassowaries can swallow fruits and other plants whole, digest the pulp and excrete seeds intact in dung piles (aka natural fertilisers). This ability to disperse large seeds helps to maintain healthy ecosystems by promoting vegetation regeneration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better illustrate how cassowaries support native plant dispersal across rainforest ecosystems, Callum and Shandiya from the ALA Science and Decision Support team have created an interactive map. The map shows 15 native plant species across the QLD wet tropics against cassowary records in the ALA!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\">Check out the interactive map!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"534\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1024x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48855\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1024x534.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-300x156.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-768x400.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1536x801.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-2048x1068.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1920x1001.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about native seeds in tropical areas, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ath.org.au\/\">Australian Topical Herbarium<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#WorldCassowaryDay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Celebrating #WorldCassowaryDay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":48857,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48809"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48856,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809\/revisions\/48856"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/48857"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48809"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48809"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48809"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":48740,"date":"2023-08-25T10:42:56","date_gmt":"2023-08-25T00:42:56","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=48740"},"modified":"2023-08-25T10:42:56","modified_gmt":"2023-08-25T00:42:56","slug":"ala-national-science-week-2023-recordings","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/ala-national-science-week-2023-recordings\/","title":{"rendered":"ALA National Science Week 2023 recordings"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate National Science Week 2023, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) hosted three free virtual events.

One of the most effective tools for protecting our native biodiversity is having access to information that shows where species are and how their populations are changing over time. Taxonomic groups like invertebrates, fungi and plants are underrepresented in species occurrence records, therefore the number of identified threatened species from these groups is thought to be much higher than current reported figures.
