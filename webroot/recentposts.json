Why is the field of taxonomy so important to the ALA\u2019s work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taxonomy provides the mechanism to identify and classify organisms. It\u2019s vital to the ALA because the name of the species observed is one of the three core pieces of information (with location and date) that is required to create a species occurrence record. It\u2019s estimated that only about a third of the +700,000 species found in Australia have been given a scientific name.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aggregating species data is reliant on the records being accurately identified at the lowest resolution of the taxonomic hierarchy possible. Identifying organisms in a particular place is important to making decisions about natural resource management and understanding changing climates.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taxonomy provides a way to both get data into the ALA and to search for data. All incoming data points are matched to the \u2018taxonomic backbone\u2019 or placed into the classification hierarchy in the ALA infrastructure.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It\u2019s important to be aware that taxonomic names are not static and are continually being revised. This is because researchers learn more (through techniques such as genetic analysis) to better understand how to delineate species. The ALA is on a constant journey to update our taxonomic backbone, to ensure our structure is as current and accurate as possible.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Tell us about taxonomy in your career?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I wouldn\u2019t call myself a taxonomist, both my honours and PhD projects were in zoophysiology rather than taxonomy, but I have been around taxonomy since I started working at Museums Victoria after my PhD in 1995. Earlier than that, I\u2019ve had an interest in collecting biological things since I was a child. I would collect shells at the beach, sorting, identifying, and labelling them. Even as a nine-year-old, I would pack a bag full of books alongside my beach towel, so that I could identify my finds. I had a logbook for recording what I collected each year, so I guess that\u2019s where it started!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I think that for many people, wanting to know what an animal or plant is called is their first interaction with taxonomy \u2013 even if they wouldn\u2019t put it that way. At Museums Victoria, I led a fantastic team to develop&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/museumsvictoria.com.au\/apps\/national-field-guide-apps\/\"><em>The National Field Guide<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;apps project. It was a collaborative project with museums around Australia to write species descriptions, gather photographs and sounds to allow anyone to identify common species near them.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"805\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/National-Field-guide-app-Museums-Victoria-1024x805.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the Museums Victoria Field Guide app\" class=\"wp-image-48336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/National-Field-guide-app-Museums-Victoria-1024x805.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/National-Field-guide-app-Museums-Victoria-300x236.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/National-Field-guide-app-Museums-Victoria-768x603.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/National-Field-guide-app-Museums-Victoria.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>National Field Guide App for Victoria.

TDWG sets and evolves international standards such as <a href=\"https:\/\/dwc.tdwg.org\/\">Darwin Core<\/a> that make the work that ALA and our partners do possible.

At last year\u2019s GBIF Governing Board meeting in Brussels, the ALA and our biological collections partners in CSIRO successfully bid to host the 2023 meeting of the Governing Board in Australia. The meeting will follow directly from the TDWG event and will be hosted in Canberra in mid-October. It\u2019s been 20 years since Australia hosted a meeting of the Governing Board and we are excited to welcome our international partners.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I\u2019d like to reflect on a remarkable experience our team had over recent months hosting two Indigenous Internship students. We welcomed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/meet-caitlin-an-ala-indigenous-internship-student-with-a-flare-for-coding\/\">Caitlin Ramsay <\/a>(University of New South Wales) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/diving-into-dingo-data-with-amos-smith\/\">Amos Smith<\/a> (University of Western Australia) who partnered with our Science and Decision Support team over the summer period on two applied projects.

I currently am the Sector Lead for ALA\u2019s biosecurity and citizen science initiatives.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Q: Can you describe your educational and career journey? How did you become interested in pursuing science?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I\u2019ve always loved the natural environment, I grew up canoe camping with my family in remote areas of Northern Ontario which was formative. I\u2019ve never really known what I wanted to do, but I\u2019ve let my passion and interest in the environment shape my career. That\u2019s resulted in some amazing experiences from aerial moose surveys in Nova Scotia for my Bachelor of Science (Honours) work, modelling wombat presence on the Snowy Mountains Highway for my PhD and working in semi-arid ecology. After university, I became interested in the science-policy interface and joined the New South Wales Environment department to understand science translation. I was lucky enough to have several roles; one of which led me to thinking about how to engage a broader cohort of people in science via citizen science to drive impact. That interest then led me to the ALA.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/DSCN1444-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48146\" width=\"344\" height=\"455\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Erin undertaking wombat research <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Q: Other than being awarded a Churchill Fellowship, what has been a career highlight for you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I attended a United Nations Science-Policy Business meeting in Nairobi as well as the International Union for Conservation of Nature conference in Hawaii as part of a delegation. My highlight though is just the diversity of experiences I\u2019ve had throughout my career ranging from remote field work to getting to meeting diverse people while being involved in challenging and interesting work.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Q: Can you describe your Churchill Fellowship project?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.churchilltrust.com.au\/fellow\/erin-roger-nsw-2022\/\"><em>&nbsp;Churchill Fellowship project<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;is related to what I do at the ALA. I\u2019m interested in how to engage communities in biosecurity surveillance, essentially getting more eyes and ears on the ground. There are some great examples globally we can learn from. I\u2019ve set a bit of a whirlwind schedule travelling to New Zealand, Samoa, the US, Denmark, Belgium, and the UK. I have a range of meetings lined up including Indigenous leaders, government, NGOs and academics.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Q: How do you believe diversity in science can drive innovation and progress?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More diverse teams can shape research priorities and challenge norms. The more people involved lead to a diversity in thinking of how problems are represented and solved. Citizen science is a great way to increase diversity, but it also comes with challenges like thinking through ethics, proper attribution, exploitation and ensuring a diversity of communication methods. These considerations aren\u2019t just unique to citizen science and can be used to inform STEM development more broadly.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Q: What advice would you give to young women considering a career in science?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pursue what you\u2019re interested in and passionate about. If you can\u2019t put a name to what specific job you want, that\u2019s okay. The ALA didn\u2019t exist when I was in high school. I think a background in STEM can open-up opportunities that we can\u2019t really imagine right now. It can also lead to a diverse career working across a number of areas<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Q: In your opinion, how can we encourage more girls and women to pursue careers in science?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It\u2019s important to put the ladder down so to speak. Wherever people are in their career, there are opportunities to give a hand up. If you see amazing women doing a great job, tell them and, equally important, tell others. Word about talent spreads quickly. The more people that see women in a diversity of positions the easier it is to pursue a career in science.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The&nbsp;Churchill Fellowship Trust&nbsp;is a highly competitive awards program that provides opportunities for individuals to travel overseas to gain new knowledge and perspectives in their field of work.
