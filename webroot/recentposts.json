She has conducted native bee biodiversity surveys across the Swan Coastal Plain and Jarrah forest of southwest of Western Australia, the wheatbelt, Gascoyne and Goldfields of WA, and Traditional landowner lands in northern Western Australia for her PhD, surveys for local and state government, land care groups, and communities. She has amassed an incredible collection of native bee specimens, which includes new range records, species not collected for decades, and many undescribed species. Thanks to the ALA Data Mobilisation Program, these specimens are finally making their way onto the map and being catalogued at the WA Museum, representing a rich dataset for researchers now and in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Facilitator: Dr Martin Westgate<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/events.csiro.au\/~\/media\/Images\/Events\/E-ALATAB-240220\/alamoderator-martin-westgate-135px.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=000621C778F9C3B05D12070053119AA1E746D4F9\" alt=\"Dr Martin Westgate\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin Westgate leads the Science and Decision Support team at the Atlas of Living Australia.

They lay bright green eggs, with dads stepping up to be in charge of incubation and chick rearing. Once the eggs hatch, baby cassowaries can walk almost immediately with their strong back legs. Babies are not born with their signature black plumage, instead have banded yellow and brown striped patterning as chicks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/edit.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48811\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius<\/em>) chick.

Cassowaries are notorious for communicating through deep rumbles, hisses and grunting sounds. Cassowaries use various vocalisations to communicate through their dense rainforest habitats. If you hear a cassowary calling, make sure you keep your distance. Equipped with a razor-sharp beak, talons and a particularly territorial nature, cassowaries are more than capable of tearing through flesh if they feel threatened. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keystone species<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cassowaries are \u2018keystone species\u2019 &#8211; species which has a disproportionately important role in their natural ecosystems. In rainforest habitats across northern QLD, cassowaries play a critical role in dispersing many native seeds through fragmented rainforest landscapes. Due to their large size, cassowaries can swallow fruits and other plants whole, digest the pulp and excrete seeds intact in dung piles (aka natural fertilisers). This ability to disperse large seeds helps to maintain healthy ecosystems by promoting vegetation regeneration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better illustrate how cassowaries support native plant dispersal across rainforest ecosystems, Callum and Shandiya from the ALA Science and Decision Support team have created an interactive map. The map shows 15 native plant species across the QLD wet tropics against cassowary records in the ALA!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\">Check out the interactive map!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/edit.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1024x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48855\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about native seeds in tropical areas, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ath.org.au\/\">Australian Topical Herbarium<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#WorldCassowaryDay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Err&#8230; is that a bird or a dinosaur?
