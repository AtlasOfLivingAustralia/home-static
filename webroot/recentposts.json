This free resource provides up-to-date information on data cleaning processes for anybody who handles their data using code in R. As Australia\u2019s national biodiversity database, the ALA is frequently asked questions about the best way to clean data using code.&nbsp; To provide advice on this topic, our first step was to investigate what the currently accepted \u201cbest\u201d way might be. We deep-dived into multiple recent peer-reviewed research to see whether experts cleaned their biodiversity data in the same way.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"712\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-712x1024.png\" alt=\"cover of the data cleaning book, with dark blue background and an orange crustacean\" class=\"wp-image-49700\" style=\"width:312px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-712x1024.png 712w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-208x300.png 208w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-768x1105.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-1067x1536.png 1067w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-1423x2048.png 1423w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R.png 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px\" \/><\/figure><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Through this process we discovered that the steps to clean ecological data can be really messy!

Beyond the biological collections sector, the ALA will improve the reach and depth of its partnerships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, working more closely with Indigenous ranger programs to co-design and deliver training programs to enhance the utility of the ALA. Similarly, this year we established a number of partnerships with the environmental consulting sector given the critical role they play in assessing and monitoring Australia\u2019s biodiversity, and we plan to extend these partnerships to support improved translation of research infrastructure to industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our workplan also identifies project leads from the ALA, and we encourage you to reach out to our team to learn more or to collaborate.
