But what promotes this incredible diversity? In my work, I investigate the principal factors that shape the adaptation and diversification of reptiles at multiple dimensions, ranging from speciation processes, to variations in morphology, ecology and genetic diversity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>What made you pursue this kind of work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve always loved reptiles and wanted to learn more about them, including their great diversity, as well as help in their conservation. I\u2019m also very interested in studying questions around climate variation given our rapidly changing environment. I\u2019ve been fortunate to be able to combine these interests as reptiles, as well as being amazing creatures, are an excellent model of study for the questions I am interested in \u00ad\u2013 as ectotherms, they are sensitive to climate variation in space and time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Morelia_viridis.jpeg\" alt=\"Morelia viridis, a green tree python - juvenile (yellow)\" class=\"wp-image-45618\" width=\"559\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Morelia_viridis.jpeg 811w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Morelia_viridis-300x280.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Morelia_viridis-768x717.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" \/><figcaption><em>Morelia viridis<\/em> (Green Python) \u2013 juvenile.

I fell in love with the ALA when I started using the spatial portal to show the relationships between plants, animals and place. I was constantly calling the ALA to ask to show it off at schools and workshops \u2013 finally they reneged and based on my extensive work with Aboriginal communities in the Kimberley and fire mapping, offered me the position to lead the IEK. I feel incredibly honoured to be doing this work, with the amazing people I work with in community and the ALA, and to be sharing this knowledge that helps bridge the gap between traditional and western science and ultimately improves our management of our land and sea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is your role at the ALA, and what do you do?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I lead the ALA\u2019s Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK) program. The aim of the IEK program is to promote Indigenous ecological knowledge in the ALA. I am doing this by working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to include their language and knowledge in the ALA where it directly links to the Western science knowledge for plants and animals. While I lead the IEK program within the ALA each project with each community is co-led and co-designed with our Partner Researchers &#8211; people and organisations who are working directly with communities to collect, store and protect Indigenous language and ecological knowledge about plants and animals. My role is to facilitate the flow of knowledge into the ALA from our Partner Researchers and work with the ALA to ensure the communities goals and aspirations around sharing their language and knowledge are being met.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there something in particular at the ESA conference you\u2019re looking forward to this year?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am excited to share this work with ecologists and environmental scientists from around Australia as an integral step in accessing all the knowledge we need to look after our environment.

Members of the public participate by using the DigiVol platform to transcribe insect specimen labels in CSIRO\u2019s National Insect Collection. DigiVol is run by the Australian Museum and is supported by Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) infrastructure. Volunteers have already digitised and transcribed 1000s of specimens. Many of the insect specimens being digitised have few or no occurrence records in the ALA and some specimens date back nearly 100 years. This information will help us understand historical changes in insect distribution across space and time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-atlas-of-living-australia-delivering-research-ready-data-for-bushfire-research-and-recovery\">The Atlas of Living Australia delivering research-ready data for bushfire research and recovery<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This work builds on the lead role the ALA took after the 2019-20 bushfires to explore how the citizen science sector could be supported<br>and coordinated to help deliver research-ready data in the bushfire space. Products from this work included the Citizen Science Bushfire<br>Project Finder and tailored blogs highlighting projects to participate in pre and post disaster events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IN PARTNERSHIP WITH: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OUR COLLABORATORS:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Centre for Ecosystem Science at UNSW<\/li><li>Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at<\/li><li>Western Sydney University<\/li><li>Australian Citizen Science Association<\/li><li>Minderoo\u2019s Fire and Flood Resilience initiative<\/li><li>National Research Collections Australia, CSIRO<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"more-information\">More information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, read Citizen science to boost existing bushfire recovery activities or contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@ala.org.au\">support@ala.org.au<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE) are working together on three new innovative citizen projects to enhance our understanding of how Australia\u2019s biodiversity responds to fire and supports bushfire recovery. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":45498,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[170,11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/45495"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=45495"}],"version-history":[{"count":13,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/45495\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":45516,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/45495\/revisions\/45516"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/45498"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=45495"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=45495"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=45495"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
