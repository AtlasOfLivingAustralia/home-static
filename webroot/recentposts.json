From there, I\u2019ve been on this journey and found out more about bees than I ever expected!\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her quest for more information, Liz contacted Entomologist Juanita Rodriguez at CSIRO\u2019s Australian National Insect Collection, who confirmed the sighting was pretty rare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a rare event Liz captured and she took an excellent photo. &nbsp;Bees release liquid waste called uric acid, but they release it in such small amounts so it\u2019s unusual to witness it \u2013 and images like this are rare,\u201d said Juanita.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uric acid is a liquid waste that is formed in a bees malpighian tubules \u2013 the insect equivalent of kidneys. Here, it\u2019s mixed with other waste products before it is expelled out of the body. The amount of uric acid that\u2019s released is very small. This makes an image capturing this moment very rare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this, Juanita encouraged Liz to upload the observation to iNaturalist Australia. This enabled the sighting to become a useful piece of biodiversity data accessible via the ALA. The <a href=\"https:\/\/inaturalist.ala.org.au\/observations\/65599556\">observation<\/a>, known as an occurrence record, contains useful data such as location, date, time as well as information about the species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different apps that feed data into the ALA. For a full list of apps and citizen science projects search the <a href=\"https:\/\/biocollect.ala.org.au\/acsa#isCitizenScience%3Dtrue%26isWorldWide%3Dfalse%26max%3D20%26sort%3DdateCreatedSort\">Australian Citizen Science Project Finder<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI knew this was a rare photograph, and I thought there must be someone somewhere who can use this photo for bee education or similar. But I was at loss on where I could post it to share it properly,\u201d said Liz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was really grateful to learn about iNaturalist and am really happy to share it with others who also may find it interesting. I love my little bee photo \u2013 I\u2019ve called him Bubble Bum due to the bubble on his bum!\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To upload your own observations, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/inaturalist.ala.org.au\/\">https:\/\/inaturalist.ala.org.au<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amateur naturalist Liz Barratt caught this candid photo of a European Honey Bee on her property in Moffatdale, Queensland.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44479,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11,14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44478"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44478"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44478\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44487,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44478\/revisions\/44487"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44479"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44478"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44478"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44478"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":44420,"date":"2020-11-16T14:56:08","date_gmt":"2020-11-16T03:56:08","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=44420"},"modified":"2020-11-17T14:48:40","modified_gmt":"2020-11-17T03:48:40","slug":"celebrating-10-years-of-science-impact","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/celebrating-10-years-of-science-impact\/","title":{"rendered":"Celebrating 10 years of science impact"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/20322-ALA-10-Stats-for-10-Years-Infographic-images-07-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"Illustration showing research publications\" class=\"wp-image-44421\" width=\"293\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/20322-ALA-10-Stats-for-10-Years-Infographic-images-07-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/20322-ALA-10-Stats-for-10-Years-Infographic-images-07-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/20322-ALA-10-Stats-for-10-Years-Infographic-images-07-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/20322-ALA-10-Stats-for-10-Years-Infographic-images-07-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/20322-ALA-10-Stats-for-10-Years-Infographic-images-07-1536x1536.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/20322-ALA-10-Stats-for-10-Years-Infographic-images-07-2048x2048.png 2048w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/20322-ALA-10-Stats-for-10-Years-Infographic-images-07-1920x1919.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA brings together occurrence record data, taxonomic information, spatial and historical information on species distributions, and environmental data.
