In 2015, a mysterious virus swept through the Bellinger River in northern New South Wales, wiping out a staggering 90% of the critically endangered <a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/https:\/biodiversity.org.au\/afd\/taxa\/e8b0899e-0148-45ba-b2eb-2c42c3ad3d96\">Bellinger River Snapping Turtle (<\/a><em><a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/https:\/biodiversity.org.au\/afd\/taxa\/e8b0899e-0148-45ba-b2eb-2c42c3ad3d96\">Myuchelys georgesi)<\/a> <\/em>population. This devastating event highlighted the urgent need for large-scale freshwater turtle conservation efforts. Researchers from leading Australian universities knew traditional methods wouldn&#8217;t suffice. They needed a way to harness the power of the public, a way to give everyone a voice in turtle conservation. Enter citizen science, and the innovative 1MT project was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49463\" style=\"width:1001px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1920x1440.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-640x480.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bellinger River Snapping Turtle (<em>Myuchelys georgesi)<\/em> Photo Credit Darren Fielder CC BY NC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What role does citizen science play in this project?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizen science is at the very core of 1MT. Why? Because freshwater turtles are shy and elusive creatures. Traditional research methods often lack the necessary scope to track their populations effectively. Imagine the difference millions of eyes across the country can make! Through the user-friendly <a href=\"https:\/\/turtlesat.org.au\/turtlesat\/default.aspx\">TurtleSAT app<\/a>, citizen scientists become data collection heroes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What kind of turtle data are you interested in collecting through the TurtleSAT app?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TurtleSAT is more than just a reporting tool. Inspired by the Bellinger River crisis, the app is designed to capture a wide range of turtle data. See a healthy turtle basking on a log? Snap a picture and submit it through TurtleSAT. Witness a turtle struggling to cross a busy road? Report the location and type of road within the app. Notice unusual behaviour, like a turtle with lesions or difficulty moving? Document your observations with photos or videos and submit them through TurtleSAT. This detailed data allows researchers to identify threats, track populations, and understand the overall health of freshwater turtle populations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 1MT goes beyond mere data collection. The program is passionate about transforming participants from observers to active conservation partners. This is where the exciting turtle data comes in. Citizen scientists are trained to collect information beyond sightings. They learn nest monitoring and protection protocols, conduct standardised surveys for invasive species like foxes (think National Nest Predation Survey), and even analyse data through TurtleSAT. This fosters a sense of ownership and empowers communities to become active conservation stewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"392\" height=\"839\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Turtlesatbbb.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49477\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Turtlesatbbb.png 392w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Turtlesatbbb-140x300.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What impacts have you seen from the 1MT project so far?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of the 1MT project has been truly shell-ebrating! Winning the prestigious <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RNR4EqScorM\">Eureka Prize for Innovation in Citizen Science in 2023<\/a> served as a major validation and a springboard for further growth. The recognition brought well-deserved attention to the project&#8217;s innovative approach and its crucial role in turtle conservation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting aspect of 1MT is the collaboration with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nativetitlesa.org\/pbcs\/ngarrindjeri-aboriginal-corporation-rntbc\/\">Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal Corporation<\/a>. This partnership aims to record the rich knowledge and history of turtles held by the Ngarrindjeri people, the Traditional Owners of the land. Integrating Indigenous knowledge systems with scientific research offers invaluable insights into turtle ecology and conservation practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what exciting discoveries have emerged from the mountains of data collected so far? Well, the results are nothing short of fascinating! Citizen science data has played a key role in identifying hotspots of turtle mortality on roads. This has led to targeted signage, infrastructure improvements, and the creation of &#8220;Turtle-Safe&#8221; roads. Additionally, the data has informed conservation advice documents for numerous turtle species under the <em>EPBC Act<\/em>, a critical step towards their protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond scientific advancements, the program has fostered a positive shift in public attitudes and behaviours towards turtles. Community initiatives like Turtle Islands \u2013 safe havens built by local communities for nesting turtles \u2013 showcase the power of collective action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: How can the public get involved?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1MT project is actively seeking new citizen scientists to join the movement. How can you get involved? Download the <a href=\"https:\/\/turtlesat.org.au\/turtlesat\/default.aspx\">TurtleSAT app<\/a>, report your turtle sightings, and participate in data collection efforts. You can also spread awareness about the project, support fundraising initiatives, or even explore volunteering opportunities with local turtle conservation groups.

This is one of ALA\u2019s flagship programs that was designed three years ago to provide a mechanism to support the digitisation and provision of important biodiversity that may otherwise not be provided to the ALA. In the first two years the program has supported 12 remarkable teams to digitally enable their data and make it available to the ALA as open data, and through that effort internationally to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/abdmp\/\">12 current projects <\/a>span a range of\u00a0incredible institutions, species, and provide important geographic coverage. This year we are excited to have secured additional support from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/en\/about\/challenges-missions\/biosecurity\">CSIRO\u2019s Catalysing Australia\u2019s Biosecurity initiative<\/a>.

We sat down with Cam Slatyer who is a Project Manager in the ALA to chat about his extensive experience and incredible stories working across taxonomy throughout his career. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: How is taxonomy evolving in the ALA and what\u2019s your role in this project?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: The ALA has a fascinating challenge with taxonomy. We bring together data from Australia and the world, historic and new. Taxonomy is a living, evolving science where names are proposed by scientists as theories, some are accepted, and some aren\u2019t. Names change over time.&nbsp; Take the Platypus, which has the scientific name (<em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus). <\/em>When it was first described by science, it was called <em>(Platypus anatinus<\/em>), but someone discovered that the name was already being used for a group of beetles (and still is). You can\u2019t have that in taxonomy. The International Codes of Nomenclature (which definitely aren\u2019t like the Pirate Code in <em>Pirates of the Caribbean<\/em>) try to stop that sort of thing. It\u2019s like not having two people in the same friendship with the same name: they end up getting called Cam 1 and Cam 2 or Blue because one has red hair. This has meant that the poor old Platypus has a scientific name that means duck-like bird-snout&#8230; which is a pretty good description really.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the ALA, we need to cope with all names,  for everything from viruses to mountain ash to make sure that data end up under the best available name. That has been a challenge ever since the ALA first started, but now with more than 135 million records, it is vast. My job with my colleagues, is to improve it. We rely heavily on the Australian Government\u2019s Australian Biological Resources Study, who have spent the last few years putting together a National Species List, as well as the Australian Plant Census, run by all the herbaria in Australia, to get our names. We also take names from the New Zealand Organism Register and the International Catalogue of Life to make names match. So our job for the next year or so, is removing things like duplicates, adding missing names and improving name matching. One of our biggest challenges is the differences between Australia and New Zealand. It isn\u2019t just the All Blacks we need to keep an eye on! There are important scientific reasons why Australia and New Zealand have different names for the same things, but we are trying to make sure the New Zealand species have New Zealand names and the Australian species have Australian names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC.jpg 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Platypus (<em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus) <\/em>Photo Credit adamrichardt CC BY NC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Tell us about your experience working in taxonomy!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: I\u2019m not a taxonomist, but I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work alongside taxonomists for many years. I\u2019ve seen an amazing array of new species and been privileged enough to have three species named after me. My favourite experience was working on heritage listing mound springs, which are incredibly important and unique freshwater springs in Queensland and South Australia, having species that are often found nowhere else on Earth. I was accompanying a freshwater snail taxonomist, looking for new species and checking on existing ones. We\u2019d been through dozens of springs and hadn\u2019t found any new species, which was enormously frustrating. I was looking for frogs while my colleagues were sieving for snails (mound spring snails are tiny). I found these little black dots on some leaves and showed them to the scientist. Turns out it was the only new species of the trip, were described and then immediately identified as endangered. Not bad for a frog person!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What are some current challenges in the field of taxonomy?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Sadly, the biggest challenge is the same as when I first started working with taxonomists in the late 1990s. We are running out of taxonomists, which is frightening given they are essential for identifying threats such as the recent Varroa mite incursion, or understanding the status of threatened species. Over a third of the taxonomists in Australia are voluntary \u2013 retirees or people doing taxonomy in their spare time. Government funding for taxonomy hasn\u2019t been increased since 1974 and museums and herbaria are the mainstay of our capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Do you have a favourite species?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Australia has around 154,000 named species.

Species taxonomy is continuously evolving based on new scientific discoveries (new species being described), as well as techniques such as genetic sequencing, bioinformatics and advanced imaging which can change the way researchers understand existing species leading to re-classification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To accurately reflect current taxonomy of species listed within the ALA, we are continuously working to improve our \u2018taxonomic backbone\u2019 i.e. source material for which species in the ALA are structured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How species are structured in the ALA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/support.ala.org.au\/support\/solutions\/articles\/6000261677-taxonomy-in-the-ala\">taxonomic backbone<\/a>&nbsp;is principally sourced from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/biodiversity.org.au\/nsl\/\">National Species List (NSL)<\/a>, but we also draw names from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nzor.org.nz\/\">New Zealand Organism Register (NZOR)<\/a>&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.catalogueoflife.org\/\">Catalogue of Life (CoL)<\/a>. We have recently undergone significant changes to align our taxonomic backbone to better fit current scientific names recognised in Australia. This reduces duplication of species listings in the ALA and improves accuracy and navigation when users are searching for new species or threatened species records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the numbers?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2023, the ALA had 154,506 species of animals (with 2,400 unranked animal species listings) and 48,972 species of plants (with 5,555 unranked plant species listings), giving a total of ~ 211,000 plant and animal species recorded in the ALA. Unranked species are species that either cannot be placed in the taxonomy or have been added to enable data matching to an existing species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through our recent work to improve ALA\u2019s taxonomic backbone removing duplication and aligning to current taxonomy, we have reduced these listings to 124,999 animal species (with 11 unranked) and 41,740 plant species (with 37 unranked). Whilst improving ALA\u2019s taxonomy is an evolving process, this represents a major removal of duplication and error fixing in the ALA\u2019s species listings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do these changes look like in the ALA?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though much of the work to refresh the ALA taxonomic backbone is in the back-end, here are some visible changes that you may notice across the ALA:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improving synonym matching<\/strong> \u2013 With thousands of unique species in Australia, and more being described and named every year, many species are known by more than one name. While the ALA uses the NSL to source synonyms for species (different names referring to the same speices), there are still differences in names, particularly those used internationally. For example, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/https:\/\/biodiversity.org.au\/afd\/taxa\/0d3239e3-927e-43c1-9d65-4a5e75fe33d3\">Green Tree Frog (<em>Litoria caerulea<\/em>)<\/a>\u00a0is known internationally as (<em>Ranoidea careulea)<\/em>\u00a0in data sets such as iNaturalist. The changed taxonomy will now mean that many of these synonyms will match to the scientific name that species are most commonly known by in Australia.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Placing names in the taxonomic hierarchy<\/strong> \u2013 The ALA places species within a taxonomy tree, like a family tree. The taxonomic backbone refresh means that we have resolved many previous errors and repeat entries for invertebrates, vertebrates and vascular plants.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Correcting species entries<\/strong> \u2013 We have taken steps to remove duplications and unresolved synonyms in the ALA by reducing the number of sources for our taxonomic backbone. We have therefore removed the Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota (CAAB) and the NZOR as a source of names for vertebrates and invertebrates. We have also consolidated all minor sources into four edited lists that add names used in legislation or species management that do not occur in the NSL \u2013 these include a conservation list, a migratory species list, a pests and weeds list and a biosecurity invasive list (species not found in Australia).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"737\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala-1024x737.jpg\" alt=\"the taxonomic classification of the masked owl, shown in the form of a hierarchy\" class=\"wp-image-49250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala-1024x737.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala-300x216.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala-768x552.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala.jpg 1297w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Example of classifying species in a hierarchy on the ALA.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will continue to further improve the ALA taxonomic backbone over the next twelve to eighteen months and resolve issues that have not already addressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are continuing to provide both NSL and NZOR names for plant species, at the request of the <a href=\"https:\/\/chah.gov.au\/\">Council of Australasian Herbaria<\/a>.&nbsp;There will continue to be some duplication both in the taxonomic tree and in scientific name synonyms between Australia and New Zealand.

Home to more than 132 million species occurrence records of native and introduced species, the ALA is often the first platform where invasive species incursions are publicly recorded. Invasive species \u2013 like pests, weeds, and diseases \u2013 are a major driver of biodiversity loss and pose significant threats to both the economy and our community. To ensure management authorities are notified of new incursions, the ALA has partnered with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agriculture.gov.au\/\">Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/\">CSIRO<\/a> through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/en\/about\/challenges-missions\/biosecurity\">Catalysing Australia\u2019s Biosecurity<\/a> initiative to develop the Biosecurity Alerts Service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA\u2019s Biosecurity Alerts Service provides weekly email notifications of occurrences of invasive species to management authorities. These occurrences are aggregated from more than 850 data suppliers, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/\">iNaturalist<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feralscan.org.au\/\">FeralScan<\/a>. The Biosecurity Alerts Service reports the species name, observation location, images, data provider and provides direct links to the ALA occurrence record. Up until the end of 2023, 1,441 occurrences of invasive species had triggered a biosecurity alert, which included reports of highly invasive species, such as red imported fire ants (<em>Solenopsis invicta)<\/em>, Asian sho<a>re crabs (<em>Hemigrapsus sanguineus<\/em>), m<\/a>yrtle rust and <em>Opuntia <\/em>cacti.

While we have only been using it for a short period we have already recorded several significant detections. I\u2019ve been promoting the system at every opportunity,\u201d said Steve Csurhes, Biosecurity Queensland, Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the ALA has developed new <a>spatial filtering features <\/a>within the Biosecurity Alerts Service. This has allowed users to limit alerts to within state\/territory or local government boundaries (including marine boundaries) or provide a custom spatial boundary (shapefile) for alerts within a user-defined area. This has improved the utility of biosecurity alerts, allowing them to be used more readily for reporting within National Parks boundaries or outside of biosecurity containment zones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA is currently delivering Phase 1 of the Biosecurity Alert Service, which includes roll out of the Service to Commonwealth, State and Territory biosecurity managers. Phase 2 will begin in mid-2024 with operational enhancements allowing the service to scale nationally better, and the inclusion of interested local government areas, natural resource managers, non-government organisations and others within the biosecurity sector.
