One of the most effective tools for protecting our native biodiversity is having access to information that shows where species are and how their populations are changing over time. Taxonomic groups like invertebrates, fungi and plants are underrepresented in species occurrence records, therefore the number of identified threatened species from these groups is thought to be much higher than current reported figures.

Data on species has been modified, withheld or shared based on inconsistent organisational polices. The <a>National Framework <\/a>is the first of its kind, jointly developed by the Atlas of Living Australia, the Australian Research Data Commons, all the government environmental agencies in Australia, herbaria, fauna collections, EcoCommons Australia and the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing the precise locations of restricted<a> access <\/a>species potentially risks disturbance, harm or exploitation. Therefore, access to some species information is limited, accessible only to data custodians and approved data users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Framework outlines the principles to guide data custodians and users in the sharing of restricted access species data responsibly and appropriately. By adopting a nationally consistent evidence-based approach to managing restricted access species data, the National Framework aim to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>promote responsible data-sharing practices<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>give data custodians the confidence to safely share restricted access species data<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>assist data custodians to maintain the consistency and quality of data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cBirdLife Australia has long upheld a restricted access policy for sensitive species data as a basis for our citizen science work. This gives contributors the confidence that sharing their data will not put species at risk, while still allowing for its use in conservation.

With advances in genomics, imaging, artificial intelligence and machine learning, more information can be obtained from physical-biological specimens than has ever been possible before. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA has been proud to play a key role in ensuring data emerging from Australia\u2019s collections is made findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable globally. Recently, the ALA was pleased to partner with our key stakeholders across the museums, collections and herbaria sectors to host a national workshop in Canberra. The workshop &#8211; <em>\u2018Towards a national approach to biological collections\u2019 <\/em>\u2013 brought together experts to explore current capabilities, emerging research drivers and key components that are required to support biological collections in Australia. Having our partners from across the nation meet together <a>highlighted the maturity and cohesiveness of our sector<\/a>, as well as the opportunities for international collaboration and improving data connections to deliver greater scientific benefit. We look forward to continuing collaborations to further advance work in this space at a national level. T<a>his will be pivotal in informing future priorities and co-investment pathways aligning with the recently released National Research Infrastructure Roadmap. <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a>In addition <\/a>to a focus on collections for the rest of the year, we look forward to further engaging with the broader scientific community through multiple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/where-to-find-the-atlas-of-living-australia-this-year\/\">conferences<\/a> such as the Ecological Society of Australia event in Darwin and the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) event in Hobart in the coming months.
