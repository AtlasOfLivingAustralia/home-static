This includes more than 450 type specimens and unique records from Macquarie Island. \u00a0Cumulatively these records will provide a significant increase in spatial areas of many Tasmanian species not currently represented in the ALA, accelerating the documentation of Australia\u2019s invertebrate fauna.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dbca.wa.gov.au\/science\/research-tools-and-repositories\/western-australian-herbarium\"><strong>Western Australian Herbarium \u2013<\/strong> <strong>Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> To improve the detection of invasive plants across Western Australia, this project will capture high-resolution images of herbarium specimens and mobilise this information to the ALA. \u00a0These images, along with existing data for 36,700 specimens and an additional 800 to be digitised, will be made publicly available.

It breeds in Japan and migrates to Australia for the non-breeding season. It is a cryptic bird and difficult to observe, but research has revealed very high numbers of snipe in some Victorian urban wetlands. Through the online tool developed through this project, wetlands important to support Latham\u2019s Snipe are identified and annual numbers recorded at these wetlands are included in wetland report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Impacts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Raise awareness of urban wetlands:<\/strong> The project has created a publicly accessible online system that highlights the importance of urban wetlands for biodiversity conservation. This can raise awareness among policymakers, planners, and the general public to give greater consideration to urban wetlands are resources of high biodiversity value.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved decision-making:<\/strong> By providing quantitative data on the value of urban wetlands, the project can inform better decision-making related to land use and development. This ultimately is aimed to lead to better protection of these crucial habitats.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Standardised metrics<\/strong>: The project has developed a standardised metrics based on citizen-science data for assessing urban wetland value. These metrics can facilitate comparisons across different wetlands and regions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Citizen science integration: <\/strong>The project incorporates data from citizen science initiatives like the ALA, Birdlife Australia and eBird. This can empower citizen scientists and contribute valuable data for conservation efforts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved monitoring of key bird species:<\/strong> Using the Latham&#8217;s Snipe as a case study, this project demonstrates the potential for improving understanding of declining species&#8217; distribution and habitat use in urban areas.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201dWetlands in urban areas are often overlooked in protection efforts due to a misconception that they are weedy, littered swamps that have low conservation value. However, they provide important refuge habitat for a range of species in our cities, including the Vulnerable Latham\u2019s Snipe. We developed this tool to help raise awareness of the biodiversity value of small urban wetlands by presenting snapshots of data recorded by citizen scientists,<\/em>\u201d said Dr Birgita Hansen, Project Lead and Senior Research Fellow at Federation University. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the online tool <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au\/\">here<\/a>.

Although this is quite different to the work that I was originally carrying out in the NISP program, learning how to work collaboratively in a team environment and achieve various goals under the guidance and support of my supervisors proved valuable in preparing me for my current role. I was also able to work on a few different tasks for the duration of the NISP program such as assisting in the development of <a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\">galah-python<\/a> which improved upon my software development skills. The NISP program also allowed me to become more confident in my skillset and learn how to approach and solve novel problems, which are all useful in helping me to complete my day-to-day tasks within the ARGA team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What made you want to come back to CSIRO as a full-time employee after your internship?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had an absolute deadly time during my internship mainly due to the stimulating and rewarding work I was undertaking but even more so because of the friendly and welcoming people I got to work with. The culture that the ALA and CSIRO foster is unmatched, and I definitely grew to miss the company of the people I worked alongside which is why I reached out to see if there were any opportunities available after I had graduated!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Square-posts-59-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49485\" style=\"width:496px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Square-posts-59-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Square-posts-59-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Square-posts-59-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Square-posts-59-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Square-posts-59.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Caitlin after graduating from her double degree from UNSW.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to other students considering undertaking a CSIRO NISP internship?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking about applying, just do it!
