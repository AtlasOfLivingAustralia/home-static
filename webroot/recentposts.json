This group includes species such as the ostrich, rhea, kiwi, cassowary and tinamou. The ratites are one of the most pre-historic groups of birds, in part because they are highly adaptable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emus have persisted in Australia through thousands of years; but anecdotal evidence suggests they are less common than they used to be. Increasing urbanisation and the removal of emus from farming lands means this species isn\u2019t as widespread as it once was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With populations condensing we begin to ask where will be the safe haven for emus in the future? It turns out answering this simple question is harder than you\u2019d think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every species has an area across which it can be found \u2013 a \u2018geographic distribution\u2019. Knowing exactly where this is helps us develop an understanding of the species, how it may adapt over time, and assist in decision making about conservation. For example, if a species only lives in a small area, it may be of larger concern compared to species that can be found all over the country, across a wide range of habitats and climates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia\u2019s climate has changed over many thousands of years, and the species that live here have moved with it. The country has been subject to long periods where it was wetter or drier, and where sea levels were lower or higher. This begged a series of questions &#8211; how have emus adapted to these changes, being one of the most pre-historic species? What effect have these changes had on where emus can live? How will this change with further human impact on the environment?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Emu-study-figure-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44779\" width=\"495\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Emu-study-figure-4.jpg 657w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Emu-study-figure-4-300x223.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" \/><figcaption>Predicted distribution change from ensemble models, across Australia and the Great Dividing Range region, past to present and present to future. The figures were generated in R (version 3.6.0,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.r-project.org\/\">https:\/\/www.r-project.org\/<\/a>).<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer these questions, we turned to a method called \u2018species distribution modelling\u2019 (SDM). SDMs take maps of where an animal has been seen and combines them with information about the environment at these locations, such as the climate (temperature and rainfall) and habitat (e.g. vegetation available and land uses). These combine to make a \u2018prediction map\u2019 of where a species can be found. The more sightings of a species there are, the more accurate these maps are likely to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, Emus are one of the most easily identified species and people love taking pictures of them! In fact, citizen scientists routinely record between 5,000 and 30,000 emu sightings every year across Australia. These sightings are collected and stored in a single place \u2013the Atlas of Living Australia (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\">https:\/\/www.ala.org.au<\/a>). Here, they can be freely viewed and downloaded by anyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these data, we built a model that shows the climate and habitat that emus prefer today; where suitable climate was 6,000 years ago; and where it will be in 50 years\u2019 time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found that in the past 6,000 years, emus have made vast shifts inland across central Australia. These shifts have been driven mostly by climate, with emus minimally influenced by environmental factors such as habitat type, distance from water, land use types or fire frequency. These changes have greatly expanded the emu\u2019s range and are predicted to remain stable over the next 50 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, however, emus have progressively been lost from the east coast. Now on the edge of their climatically suitable range, east coast emus are likely to be more susceptible to other threats, such as poor reproductive success due to predation by feral animals on the eggs and chicks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-1024x574.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44780\" width=\"444\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-1024x574.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-768x430.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image.jpg 1099w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" \/><figcaption>Camera trap image of emu feeding from an east coast population. Image credit: Julia Ryeland<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Emu disappearance across the east coast is unlikely to make the species vulnerable to the threat of extinction, because of the stability of their overall expansive range. However, the local extinction of emu populations across the east coast could have ecosystem wide implications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emus can travel up to 100km a year and move the seeds of native plants huge distances with them as they go. Without emus, many plant species will find it harder to disperse to new habitats or share genetic material between isolated plant communities. Combined with other threats such as habitat loss and predation by introduced species, our east coast plant communities could soon be in trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as poignant, though, is the importance of emus in Australian culture, both in European and Indigenous histories. The emu is a totem to many indigenous groups and is shown on the Australian coat of arms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the east coast where urbanisation is progressing rapidly, encountering a species such as the emu gives many Australian\u2019s an important connection to nature that can help inspire conservation efforts for our lesser known, declining fauna.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, read the full journal article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-020-79551-0\">Past and future potential range changes in one of the last large vertebrates of the Australian continent, the emu\u00a0<em>Dromaius novaehollandiae<\/em><\/a> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Julia Ryeland, Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44778,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44776"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44776"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44776\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44783,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44776\/revisions\/44783"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44778"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44776"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44776"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44776"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":44748,"date":"2021-05-25T16:34:46","date_gmt":"2021-05-25T06:34:46","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=44748"},"modified":"2021-05-26T12:17:00","modified_gmt":"2021-05-26T02:17:00","slug":"directors-message-may-2021","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/directors-message-may-2021\/","title":{"rendered":"Director&#8217;s message &#8211; May 2021"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44152\" width=\"154\" height=\"154\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d like to welcome you to the May 2021 edition of our newsletter in which&nbsp;we profile a number of exciting developments&nbsp;in&nbsp;the ALA.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, it\u2019s a&nbsp;pleasure&nbsp;to be releasing&nbsp;the&nbsp;ALA\u2019s&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/ALA-Workplan-2021-22_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">annual work&nbsp;plan&nbsp;for&nbsp;2021-22<\/a>.&nbsp;Mid-last year we were excited to&nbsp;release&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ALA Strategy 2020-25<\/a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;work&nbsp;plan provides an&nbsp;annual&nbsp;view into ALA priorities as articulated primarily through projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work&nbsp;plan is an&nbsp;outcome&nbsp;of&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;stakeholder conversations, the insight of the ALA leadership team and&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;from the ALA Advisory Board.

Government biosecurity efforts aim to prevent, respond to and assist recovery from pests and diseases, with particular focus on the invasive species that threaten our environment and the economy. Early detection of exotic and introduced pest species is crucial to managing and eradicating invasive pests. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EBO is charged with protecting Australia\u2019s native flora, fauna and associated social amenity from the damaging effects of exotic pests, weeds and diseases that come  from overseas. One of their biggest challenges is knowing when pests and diseases first come into Australia and keeping track of their spread across the country. International border controls and quarantine measures are crucial elements for biosecurity control, but pests, weeds and diseases can still elude these controls. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) harnesses innovative solutions to complement existing methods of detection to further bolster biosecurity incursion surveillance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For over ten years, the ALA \u2013 our national biodiversity data infrastructure \u2013 has been aggregating occurrence records of plant, animals and fungi species from over 700 data partners. In 2020, the ALA worked closely with DAWE to establish automatic alerts for targeted species on the National Priority List of Exotic Environmental Pests, Weeds and Diseases that are considered the greatest biosecurity risks to Australia. Using this list, the ALA set up an alert system. Now, when observations of those target species are uploaded to the database, an alert is sent to the EBO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ala-alert-provides-extra-layer-of-defence\">ALA alert provides extra layer of defence<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44698\" width=\"408\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--1920x1440.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--640x480.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer-.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" \/><figcaption>The Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) is considered a biosecurity threat to Australia, and was detected in Victoria in 2020.

In early 2020, a suspected sighting of the Asian shore crab by a member of the public on Port Phillip Bay in Victoria. This sighting was uploaded as a report into the ALA and provided the earliest available alert of the incursions. Early awareness of incursions into Australia by exotic species such as the Asian shore crab provide the best scenario for implementing successful management and eradication programs. If left unchecked exotic species can spread rapidly and compete with our native flora and fauna. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode demonstrated that the ALA notification system can provide over 9 months earlier warning of an incursion. Another example of the benefits of the ALA notification system, involving an exotic wasp, demonstrated that an incursion could be found 24-36 months earlier than the current reporting system. The notification system can also include a facility to validate and amend reports, which can be important for clarifying Australia\u2019s pest status. Citizen science apps such as iNaturalist Australia, among many others, feed data into the ALA and directly contribute to the national biosecurity surveillance system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <em>\u201cThe ALA alert system is simple and is proving to be an important asset to our operational capability,\u201d <\/em>said Andrew Pearce, from DAWE\u2019s Environmental Biosecurity Office<em>. <\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cThis is a layer of defence we haven\u2019t had before and it has excellent potential for further development and expansion to deliver a low cost biosecurity surveillance and monitoring capability<\/em>.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The national biosecurity alert system is an excellent example of how the ALA is able to provide trusted biodiversity data to support environmental biosecurity program managers and help deliver better outcomes for Australian ecosystems and environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/\">ala.org.au <\/a>or contact<a href=\"mailto:support@ala.org.au\"> support@ala.org.au<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/21280-ALA-Case-Study-Fact-Sheets-Biosecurity-V3-lowres.pdf\">View or print this impact story as a PDF<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Atlas of Living Australia and its large network of biodiversity data providers are helping our national<br \/>\nEnvironmental Biosecurity Office  (EBO) in the Department of  Agriculture, Water and the  Environment (DAWE) to protect  Australia\u2019s flora and fauna from  exotic biosecurity threats. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44698,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[170,11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44697"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44697"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44697\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44715,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44697\/revisions\/44715"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44698"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44697"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44697"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44697"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":44702,"date":"2021-05-24T15:59:15","date_gmt":"2021-05-24T05:59:15","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=44702"},"modified":"2021-05-26T09:31:04","modified_gmt":"2021-05-25T23:31:04","slug":"welcome-prof-stephen-van-leeuwen-to-our-ala-advisory-board","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/welcome-prof-stephen-van-leeuwen-to-our-ala-advisory-board\/","title":{"rendered":"Welcome Prof Stephen van Leeuwen to our ALA Advisory Board"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44704\" width=\"380\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-768x548.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1536x1096.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1920x1370.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Professor Stephen van Leeuwen is a respected South West Boojarah Wardandi Noongar man whose Country is in the Busselton &#8211; Margaret River area of south west Western Australia.\u00a0 He is a botanical ecologist, with a diverse research pedigree extending from threatened flora survey, fire ecology and threatened flora and fauna management through to biological survey, arid zone ecology, plant taxonomy and pollination biology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a botanical ecologist Stephen has had a long career working with biological data, from early work experience projects at the WA Herbarium, to being involved in the foundational WA Orchid Atlas and Banksia Atlas projects. He has also undertaken and managed botanical and biological surveys across the Pilbara, Gascoyne and neighbouring Western Deserts including fulfilling a leadership role in the Pilbara Biological Survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to leaving the WA Public Service, Stephen was Assistant Director of Science in the Biodiversity and Conservation portfolio at the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, overseeing operations of the WA Herbarium and of the Western Australian biodiversity data portal &#8211; NatureMap. He also collaborated with the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute (WABSI) to establish the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/newsletter\/ala-helps-improve-environmental-impact-assessments-in-western-australia\/\">Index of Biodiversity Surveys for Assessments<\/a> (IBSA) program and was also the WA champion for the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network\u2019s (TERN) Surveillance (formerly AusPlots and Australian Transect Network) program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Building cultural competency and engagement with Indigenous Australians<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent chat, Stephen shared with us his vision for his role with the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very keen to guide the ALA as it builds capacity and capabilities to be a culturally safe organisation that can respectfully capture, curate and support Traditional Knowledge (including language) and all it entails while ensuring the sovereignty of this knowledge, Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights and the mutual sharing of benefit derived from such knowledge,\u201d Stephen said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI hope to build the Board\u2019s cultural competency and engagement with Indigenous Australians to address the needs and aspirations of Indigenous Australians.&nbsp; In part I\u2019ll do this by unlocking opportunities within my networks across Indigenous, academic, government and corporate sectors to build collaborations and minimise duplication of effort with respect to the participation and engagement of Indigenous Australians in the operations and activities of ALA.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Making a mark: some key priorities for his tenure with the ALA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a pragmatic on-ground perspective Stephen would like to see ALA\u2019s activities continue to grow and service the needs of Indigenous land and sea Country managers and ranger teams, particularly in respect to the development of tools and applications that enable greater Traditional Knowledge capture, a reduction in the duplication of effort, and a greater emphasis on how Traditional Knowledge can help provide solutions to biodiversity conservation and land management challenges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While on the ALA Board, Stephen would like to ensure that the ALA becomes a culturally safe organisation which has a governance framework that supports Indigenous Australians and respectfully engages with them to capture Traditional Knowledge, including language.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m keen to ensure that data is appropriately managed in terms of Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights, and that sovereignty of the data remains with the Knowledge holder,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am also keen to ensure that language is captured as part of Traditional Knowledge, as language is inherently linked to culture, and Country for Indigenous Australians.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did you know?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When not working Stephen enjoys botanising, fishing, pottering around the house and in his workshop and keeping abreast of Australian ecological literature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen attended Christian Brother College in Perth for his high school education.\u00a0 He was a reasonable cross country and mid-distance runner and sprinter.\u00a0 His finishing time for the 400m sprint at the Inter-school Catholic Colleges sports carnival set in 1985 still stands!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div
