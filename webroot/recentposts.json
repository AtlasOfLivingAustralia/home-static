When I look back to the knowledge I had when I started this internship compared to what I have now, there\u2019s a really big difference.

Throughout my university experience, I haven\u2019t really had any experiences like this where we are working towards one main goal for such a long period of time. I think the process of making little steps each week towards the main goal has been a really big learning experience and it was definitely a challenge to get used to trying to achieve smaller tasks on a weekly basis rather than a larger main goal.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q) What was your highlight from the internship program?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A)&nbsp;<em>The main highlight of the internship program was having the opportunity to develop my coding skills and being able and develop this skill with help and feedback from my supervisor.

These are maps that represent where species can be found in Australia. These datasets are sent through to the ALA in different formats and layouts which need to be managed. My task was to convert all of the datasets into the format of existing expert distribution maps in the ALA and upload them so everyone can see the new maps.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q) What was a new skill you learned through the program that you\u2019re proud of?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A) I am proud to say that I can now program in Python!

I hadn\u2019t realised how exhausting it was to balance study, work, and learning Python. However, creating a structured routine has helped significantly with managing my time. It was great to have this opportunity to further develop time-management skills ahead of my honours project.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q) What was your highlight of the internship program?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A) The highlight of my internship program was seeing the maps load properly on the test server. Initially, I had many issues that had caused the maps I uploaded to not show up. Once I had figured out what I had done wrong, fixed the issues, and tried uploading again, I felt very relieved to see that the maps were loading properly.
