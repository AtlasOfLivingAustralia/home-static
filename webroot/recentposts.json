It\u2019s critically endangered with a population estimated at 300-500 individuals. This estimate was before the 2019-20 bushfires.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 90 per cent of the dunnarts\u2019 habitat was burnt in the bushfires. Therefore there\u2019s been a significant decline in the population. This means it\u2019s more important than ever to track and protect these animals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, we launched the virtual expeditions and Kangaroo Island Dunnart Survey project as part of our Citizen Science Bushfire Project. And with great success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteers from across Australia joined the expeditions. They reviewed a series of images and a list of possible animals to look out for. Keen-eyes worked out what species were in the images. And once submitted, the team sent the next set of images. Addictive, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within three weeks of launching, the volunteers identified and classified 15,000 images for the dunnart survey.
