This has involved investigating disease resistance genes in Australian native trees, which are highly diverse both within and between species. It\u2019s sparked a broader interest in researching disease resistance gene evolution, and gene diversity across native plant populations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"did-you-already-know-about-the-atlas-of-living-australia\">Did you already know about the Atlas of Living Australia?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I am familiar with the platform and have used it both during my PhD and now during my postdoc. During my PhD, I established the<a href=\"https:\/\/inaturalist.ala.org.au\/projects\/gum-tree-guardians\"> Gum Tree Guardians project <\/a>on iNaturalist as a citizen scientist initiative to increase awareness of myrtle rust in Australia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was fortunate to collaborate with Erin Roger and the ALA and Rebecca Paxton from the University of Adelaide on a broader <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/myrtle-rust-is-lethal-to-australian-plants-could-citizen-scientists-help-track-its-spread-225681\">myrtle rust campaign<\/a> to boost the total myrtle rust observations in ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also use the ALA platform (especially the spatial portal) in my postdoc role. Based at the Sydney Botanic Gardens within the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.botanicgardens.org.au\/our-science\/what-we-do\/research-centre-ecosystem-resilience\">Research Centre for Ecosystem Resilience<\/a>, I work on the population genetics of threatened plant species across NSW. The <a href=\"https:\/\/spatial.ala.org.au\/\">spatial portal<\/a> has been a great tool for planning collections of these species across the state.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Myrtle-Rust-Austropuccinia-psidii-Photo-Credit-Pete-Woodall-CC-BY-NC-edited.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50805\" style=\"width:332px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Myrtle-Rust-Austropuccinia-psidii-Photo-Credit-Pete-Woodall-CC-BY-NC-edited.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Myrtle-Rust-Austropuccinia-psidii-Photo-Credit-Pete-Woodall-CC-BY-NC-edited-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Myrtle-Rust-Austropuccinia-psidii-Photo-Credit-Pete-Woodall-CC-BY-NC-edited-768x512.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Myrtle Rust (<em>Austropuccinia psidii<\/em>).

Having recently started my first postdoc, based at the Sydney Botanic Gardens, the conference theme of collections sparked a lot of ideas for future research, especially seeing research using herbarium specimens to uncover the history, evolution, and diversity of plant pathogens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was amazed to see the preservation of fungal spores on herbarium specimens, making me think about what may be lurking in the Sydney Botanic Gardens collections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left\" class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left\" id=\"where-do-you-see-yourself-working-studying-in-plant-pathology-in-the-future-and-what-do-you-see-as-the-role-of-online-data-platforms-like-the-atlas-of-living-australia\">Where do you see yourself working\/studying in plant pathology in the future? And what do you see as the role of online data platforms like the Atlas of Living Australia?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Being born and raised in Western Australia, I see myself one day taking the learnings from my time in Sydney back to Perth or Albany. My goal is to bring high-quality plant pathology research down to the south-west biodiversity hotspot in Western Australia, with a focus on investigating disease resistance gene diversity in WA\u2019s endemic plant species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Platforms like the ALA will assist ahead of fieldwork for collections, and will also enable the collection of data on plants and pathogens during this type of research. It will be incredibly beneficial in a biodiversity hotspot which is threatened by plant pathogens like<em> Phytophthora cinnamomi<\/em>, which has already had a large impact in that region.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/ALA-Variable-Bossiaea.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50796\" style=\"width:235px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/ALA-Variable-Bossiaea.jpg 576w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/ALA-Variable-Bossiaea-169x300.jpg 169w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Variable Bossiaea (<em>Bossiaea heterophylla<\/em>).
