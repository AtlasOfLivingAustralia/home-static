This free resource provides up-to-date information on data cleaning processes for anybody who handles their data using code in R. As Australia\u2019s national biodiversity database, the ALA is frequently asked questions about the best way to clean data using code.&nbsp; To provide advice on this topic, our first step was to investigate what the currently accepted \u201cbest\u201d way might be. We deep-dived into multiple recent peer-reviewed research to see whether experts cleaned their biodiversity data in the same way.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"712\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-712x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49700\" style=\"width:312px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-712x1024.png 712w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-208x300.png 208w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-768x1105.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-1067x1536.png 1067w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R-1423x2048.png 1423w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Cleaning-Biodiversity-Data-in-R.png 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px\" \/><\/figure><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<p class=\"is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">Through this process we discovered that the steps to clean ecological data can be really messy!

The workplan acts as both an internal planning tool to guide team priorities, and for external communication purposes to provide our stakeholders with greater visibility into ALA operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2024-25 will be the fifth year of delivery under the ALA\u2019s current strategy. Priorities will include the production release of several important initiatives that commenced 2023-24, including the (a) operational national biosecurity alerts service, (b) new ALA home page, species pages and global search interface under the UX\/UI project, and (c) stage two of the taxonomic architecture project which will include improved species names matching. Collectively, these capabilities will be transformational for Australia\u2019s biodiversity data community, and we look forward to their release. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a national research infrastructure supported under the NCRIS program, partnerships are fundamental to how the ALA benefits Australia\u2019s researchers, decision-makers and community. In 2024-25, the ALA will further partner with Australia\u2019s biological collections sector and to develop a case to support a <a href=\"https:\/\/ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Accelerating_Discovery_and_Access_to_Australias_Biological_Collections_2024_June.pdf\">national approach to biological collections<\/a> akin to the major programs currently underway in Europe and the United States. Beyond the biological collections sector, the ALA will improve the reach and depth of its partnerships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, working more closely with Indigenous ranger programs to co-design and deliver training programs to enhance the utility of the ALA. Similarly, this year we established a number of partnerships with the environmental consulting sector given the critical role they play in assessing and monitoring Australia\u2019s biodiversity, and we plan to extend these partnerships to support improved translation of research infrastructure to industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our workplan also identifies project leads from the ALA, and we encourage you to reach out to our team to learn more or to collaborate.

This ultimately is aimed to lead to better protection of these crucial habitats.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Standardised metrics<\/strong>: The project has developed a standardised metrics based on citizen-science data for assessing urban wetland value. These metrics can facilitate comparisons across different wetlands and regions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Citizen science integration: <\/strong>The project incorporates data from citizen science initiatives like the ALA, Birdlife Australia and eBird. This can empower citizen scientists and contribute valuable data for conservation efforts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved monitoring of key bird species:<\/strong> Using the Latham&#8217;s Snipe as a case study, this project demonstrates the potential for improving understanding of declining species&#8217; distribution and habitat use in urban areas.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201dWetlands in urban areas are often overlooked in protection efforts due to a misconception that they are weedy, littered swamps that have low conservation value. However, they provide important refuge habitat for a range of species in our cities, including the Vulnerable Latham\u2019s Snipe. We developed this tool to help raise awareness of the biodiversity value of small urban wetlands by presenting snapshots of data recorded by citizen scientists,<\/em>\u201d said Dr Birgita Hansen, Project Lead and Senior Research Fellow at Federation University. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the online tool <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au\/\">here<\/a>.
