These data are central to the research areas of ecology, conservation, environmental planning, Indigenous ecological management and sustainability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA\u2019s contribution to the research output in these fields has steadily increased over the last 10 years. Now over 2,300 scientific publications have referenced the ALA, providing novel contributions to a range of fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers have used data from ALA to show <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.gecco.2019.e00720\">changes in Platypus numbers over the last 150 years<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/fee.2032\">identify rare species that thrive in Australian towns and cities<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/een.12856\">understand complex migration behaviour in insects<\/a> that would otherwise go undetected.

The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) was established with funding from the Australian Government\u2019s National Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) to fulfill this role and aggregate Australia\u2019s biodiversity data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe ALA has changed the way biodiversity research and environmental decision making occurs in Australia,\u201d said ALA Director Dr Andre Zerger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe now have over 90 million occurrence records and function as the most comprehensive dataset on Australian biodiversity. The ALA has over 78,000 registered users and access to 700 datasets from data partners across research, government and citizen science.\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Built on partnerships<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Central to the success of the ALA are the contributions from our data partners. They are the backbone of the ALA, providing authoritative data for species names and classification, geospatial reference data, environmental layers, and species occurrence data. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe work of the organisations and institutions that provide data, and manage, curate and update that data, underpins our success and we look forward to continuing and growing these partnerships over another ten years,\u201d said Andre.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The diverse datasets all contribute to the rich tapestries of data that are accessible via the ALA, and enable the ALA to perform like a window into the complex world of biodiversity science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>National and global reach<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA not only delivers Australia\u2019s biodiversity data at a national level, it also contributes to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world&#8217;s governments to provide open access to data about all types of life on Earth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThrough the GBIF living atlases community, the infrastructure our team first developed 10 years ago is now being used by 27 countries around the world to manage their biodiversity data,\u201d said Andre.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA is the Australian node of GBIF and has significantly contributed to this global network for open biodiversity data access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More information<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/ala-cited-publications\/\">ALA-cited publications<\/a> to search and browse publications that reference the ALA.<\/li><li>Read <a href=\"https:\/\/support.ala.org.au\/support\/solutions\/articles\/6000195866-how-to-cite-the-ala\">How to cite the ALA<\/a> for more detail on best practices for citing and acknowledging the ALA.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 2020, we\u2019re celebrating 10 years of the Atlas of Living Australia and today we launch a new feature to showcase ALA research impact.

wherever they live.\u202fFrom taking photos of local waterways to designing and building\u202fa water filter, you can explore your connection to the ocean as deeply as you\u2019d like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to the CSIRO&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/csiro.au\/scienceweekchallenge\">National Science Week Challenge website<\/a>&nbsp;to learn more, be inspired and watch the&nbsp;<a
