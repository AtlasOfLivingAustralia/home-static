Simon and his CSIRO colleagues have been developing a new generation of macroecological approaches to\u00a0biodiversity\u00a0modelling and scenario analysis, focused on assessing past-to-present change\u00a0in\u00a0the status of\u00a0biodiversity, projecting impacts of future scenarios of climate and land-use change. Prior to this, Simon spent over 20 years working with state-government agencies,\u00a0including pioneering the development of species- and community-level\u00a0biodiversity\u00a0modelling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"135\" height=\"180\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/12\/c.archibald-speaker.png\" alt=\"Carla Archibald\" class=\"wp-image-47651\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"arve-solland-ecocommons\">Carla Archibald | Centre for Integrative Ecology, Deakin University<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Carla Archibald\u00a0is a Research Fellow at Deakin\u00a0University under the\u00a0Land Use Future project.

This project aims to further develop the\u00a0LUTO\u00a0model\u00a0and to provide pathways towards sustainable environmental and food futures for the Australian agricultural landscape.\u00a0In\u00a0this Advances\u00a0in\u00a0Biodiversity Modelling talk, Carla will share some of the\u00a0biodiversity\u00a0modelling which she conducted as a part of the Land Use Future project. This\u00a0involved working with the\u00a0CliMAS team at JCU to update MaxEnt\u00a0models with CMIP6 climate data and scenarios. The outcome of this\u00a0modelling has resulted\u00a0in\u00a0the construction of specific-level data to use with the LUTO2.0 as both input data, as well as\u00a0in\u00a0the environmental accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"135\" height=\"180\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/12\/p.bal_.png\" alt=\"Payal Bal\" class=\"wp-image-47653\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ana-belgun-data61\">Payal Bal | University of Melbourne<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Payal Bal is currently based at the\u00a0Quantitative and Applied Ecology Group\u00a0at The University of Melbourne, where she works on developing models to assess the global impacts of socioeconomic trends on biodiversity and on assessing the national-level impacts of bushfires on Australian invertebrate species.

Our Year in Review showcases ALA\u2019s highlights, and reflects on the fundamental contribution made by our partners in supporting our mission. 2021-22 was an important year for the ALA, highlighted by some innovative new capability releases including <a href=\"https:\/\/labs.ala.org.au\/\">ALA Labs<\/a>, our work with partner NCRIS facilities to establish and launch <a href=\"https:\/\/ecoassets.org.au\/\">EcoAssets<\/a>, and the inaugural launch of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/abdmp\/\">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program<\/a>. Last year was also a time of significant team growth for the ALA and we now have staff in six  capital cities working with our partners, our projects and supporting our applications and systems. Having a national team has been a welcome by-product of some of the constraints imposed upon us over the past few years. Finally, doing justice to the breadth of research we enable in any year is always a challenge, but we\u2019ve showcased four stellar examples of how a national biodiversity data infrastructure enables Australian science. We hope you enjoy reading our 2021-22 story as much as we\u2019ve enjoyed building it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was recently privileged to represent the Australian delegation at the Governing Board meeting of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) held for the first time in person in three years in Brussels, but also supporting a hybrid model. It was a great opportunity to connect with people we only ever see virtually. It&#8217;s nice to see the shared challenges, understand where our partners are heading strategically and benchmark ALA\u2019s approach both technically and strategically. The global context is different to ours but nevertheless, we run a federated data infrastructure built on strong relationships across many sectors, so we learn so much at these events. An additional highlight for me was attending a one-day symposium hosted by GBIF and the European Biodiversa+ program called Data Beyond Borders that explored the role data infrastructure can play in supporting major national research and policy programs. This is clearly one of the next frontiers for capabilities such as ALA, and our partners in the NCRIS program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GBIF experience has affirmed the importance of ALA\u2019s international role, and the opportunities this affords moving forward. Our delegation concluded the meeting with a successful nomination to host the 2023 Governing Board Meeting in Canberra \u2013 it\u2019s been almost 20 years since Australia played this role and we are excited to welcome our international partners in 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been some years since we\u2019ve all travelled and engaged in person, but our team have been re-energised by this year\u2019s conference season. This has included our recent participation in eResearch Australasia in Brisbane, remote participation in the TDWG international meeting, GBIF in Europe, and in-person participation at the Ecological Society of Australia conference in Wollongong in November. I\u2019d like to conclude by acknowledging the groups and individuals that do such an amazing job designing, coordinating, and running conferences to support our sector.&nbsp; We appreciate the work you do! We hope you enjoy our November edition.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to our November newsletter<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47517"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=47517"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47517\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":47621,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/47517\/revisions\/47621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=47517"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=47517"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=47517"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":47573,"date":"2022-11-01T16:55:57","date_gmt":"2022-11-01T05:55:57","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=47573"},"modified":"2022-11-01T16:55:57","modified_gmt":"2022-11-01T05:55:57","slug":"sneak-peek-of-our-new-api-portal","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/sneak-peek-of-our-new-api-portal\/","title":{"rendered":"Sneak peek of our new API portal"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve just released a new API gateway to access our APIs: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.ala.org.au\/\">docs.ala.org.au<\/a>!

Specimens have been found along continental slopes at distances up to 1.3 km deep, measuring 3-4 metres in length. The Goblin Shark has distinctive mouthparts, specialised for rapid projection as their jaws can extend and retract to catch prey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are the only extant member of the&nbsp;<em>Mitsukurina<\/em>&nbsp;genus, often called a \u2018living fossil\u2019 as this genus traces back 125 million years. These sharks are incredibly illusive, with limited specimens recorded around NSW, Victoria and Tasmania in Australia, as well as Portugal and Japan. Not much is known about the reproductive life cycle of this species as a pregnant Goblin Shark has never been recorded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Bronze-Orange-Bug-Musgraveia-sulciventris-eRoger-via-iNaturalist-CC-BY-NC-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Bronze-Orange-Bug-Musgraveia-sulciventris-eRoger-via-iNaturalist-CC-BY-NC-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Bronze-Orange-Bug-Musgraveia-sulciventris-eRoger-via-iNaturalist-CC-BY-NC-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Bronze-Orange-Bug-Musgraveia-sulciventris-eRoger-via-iNaturalist-CC-BY-NC-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Bronze-Orange-Bug-Musgraveia-sulciventris-eRoger-via-iNaturalist-CC-BY-NC-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Bronze-Orange-Bug-Musgraveia-sulciventris-eRoger-via-iNaturalist-CC-BY-NC-1920x1440.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Bronze-Orange-Bug-Musgraveia-sulciventris-eRoger-via-iNaturalist-CC-BY-NC-640x480.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Bronze-Orange-Bug-Musgraveia-sulciventris-eRoger-via-iNaturalist-CC-BY-NC.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Bronze Orange Bug (<em>Musgraveia sulciventris<\/em>) Erin Roger CC BY NC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/taxa\/201952\">Bronze Orange Bug<\/a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/taxa\/201952\"><em>Musgraveia sulciventris<\/em><\/a>)<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the pumpkin-orange colour doesn\u2019t scare you off, maybe its stench will!
