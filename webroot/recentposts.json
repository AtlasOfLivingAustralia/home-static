The major upgrade was possible due to our close partnership with GBIF \u2013 the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas of Living Australia is the Australian node of GBIF, an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world&#8217;s governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to biodiversity data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"collaboration\"><strong>Collaboration<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our systems upgrade is the result of more than 12 months of collaborative work between teams based in Australia, UK and Denmark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development teams established a software codebase shared by both teams and worked on a framework for genuinely open-source software development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe ALA and GBIF development teams worked so well together. There\u2019s a strong sense of trust and confidence in the skills of each team leading to individual contributions contributing to the larger whole.<\/p><p>Our teams know that accessible, high quality biodiversity data is improving research and environmental outcomes across the globe and that their efforts are integral to making this happen,\u201d said Joe Miller, executive secretary of GBIF and former research group leader at the Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research, CSIRO.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"major-upgrade-reaps-benefits-for-users\"><strong>Major upgrade reaps benefits for users<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"efficiency-and-effectiveness\"><strong>Efficiency and effectiveness<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new infrastructure, using GBIF\/ALA shared codebase, increases indexing speeds for the ALA, reduces its running costs, and reduces long-term technical debt. With the ALA&#8217;s infrastructure growing in excess of millions of biodiversity occurrence records annually, such efficiencies are critical. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Javier Molina, ALA\u2019s Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project Lead, was pleased to report that users have noticed the system is more responsive, particularly when searching species data, using map-based navigation, and using the Spatial Portal (ALA\u2019s analytical tool).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cPrior to the upgrade, we were experiencing some unscheduled outages every month. Since the project went live in June, we haven\u2019t received any reports of unscheduled outages. The system has also coped well with high peaks of utilisation,\u201d said Javier.<\/p><p>\u201cWe recently ingested a dataset from eBird Australia of more than 20 million records, this went smoothy and without issue. A dataset that large would have created lots of headaches for us in the old system.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"consistency-is-key\"><strong>Consistency is key<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency between the ALA, GBIF and other biodiversity infrastructures is another component of the recent upgrade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many users of the ALA also frequently access data through GBIF. For these users, the benefits of a shared infrastructure are clear. Shared approaches to processing biodiversity data eliminate potential sources of confusion for users. For example, if there are consistent flags and interpretations, users become comfortable and proficient using multiple platforms. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"international-living-atlases-will-also-benefit-from-upgrade\"><strong>International Living Atlases will also benefit from upgrade<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Software originally developed by the Atlas of Living Australia team is increasingly used across the GBIF network. There are now 27 installations around the world. Some of these are national biodiversity databases and some are thematic, regional or institutional instances. The International Living Atlases is a collaborative global community that supports developers who implement the open-source platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cOur collaborative work with GBIF has built social capital in the global community, and it is an excellent entry point for the International Living Atlases community to jump onboard,\u201d said Javier.<br><br>\u201cCompletion of this first phase now makes it possible for the international community to co-develop new features and work on other mutual areas of interest and concern, including a shared registry and improved handling of sampling-event datasets.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Core-infrastructure-upgrade-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44911\" width=\"919\" height=\"768\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"technical-details\"><strong>Technical details<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AWS: virtual infrastructure from AWS performs better and is more affordable.

Many researchers routinely use programming languages to request data, rather than manually navigating our website. For the biodiversity research community, the most commonly used programming language is called \u2018R\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>R is a useful programming language by itself; but it\u2019s most valuable feature is the ability to write and share bundles of software \u2013 called \u2018packages\u2019 \u2013 which users can install to achieve specific tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>galah<\/em> enables ALA users to locate and download occurrence records, taxonomic information, and associated media such as images or sounds. It allows users to directly integrate data from the ALA into their analyses in R.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"naming-ala4rs-successor\">Naming ALA4R&#8217;s successor<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We chose to call our new software \u2018galah\u2019 for a few reasons. First, it is an iconic Australian species that many people will be familiar with. Second, the word galah already contains the acronym \u2018ALA\u2019. Finally, a poll of users on social media chose <em>galah<\/em> over other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This package is the successor to the earlier <em>ALA4R<\/em>, which has been available for R users since 2014. <em>galah <\/em>provides an improved and simplified user experience to <em>ALA4R<\/em>, while still providing the same core functionality. <em>ALA4R <\/em>will be maintained but not actively developed while users transition to <em>galah<\/em>, and we encourage users to make the switch as soon as practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EcoCommons-training_galah.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44816\" width=\"400\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EcoCommons-training_galah.png 650w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EcoCommons-training_galah-300x240.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><figcaption>ALA developer Matilda Stevenson (bottom right) presents galah to an EcoCommons Software Carpentry workshop in June 2021.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"early-adoption-and-recent-updates\">Early adoption and recent updates<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we developed <em>galah<\/em>, early adopters have been testing the package extensively in classes and research projects around the country.

The aim for the program is to contribute valuable pollinator and plant data so the data is freely available for anyone to use. The program has been set up on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/projects\/b-b-highway-nsw\">iNaturalist<\/a> so that all participating schools can see their observations under the umbrella B&amp;B Highway Project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the chill, the launch kicked off with a search of the garden at Ryde East Public School, where a number of young pollinator enthusiasts from different schools had been assembled. While we didn\u2019t find many pollinators, it showed the importance of seasonal sampling for true indication of pollinator diversity. Speeches, snacks and celebrations then followed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"840\" height=\"630\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2.jpg 840w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption><em>B&amp;B Highway participants looking for pollinators on a cold June day in Sydney<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone interested in finding out more about the B&amp;B Highway, and its educational resources, habitat constructions and the citizen science component <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ps.org.au\/bb-highway-school-info\">click here<\/a>.
