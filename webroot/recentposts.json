FAIR data \u2013 findable, accessible, interoperable, resuable &#8211; can be shared with other researchers and people working in biodiversity policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High quality and accessible biodiversity data helps conservation efforts and informs decision-making about environmental challenges\/issues\/solutions\/outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"funding-to-support-your-digitisation-efforts\"><strong>Funding to support your digitisation efforts<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that organising, standardising, and digitising data takes time and effort. The ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program is here to help. The grant program will award small (up to $20k) and large (up to $50k) grants to biodiversity data owners to support purchasing equipment (e.g. camera, scanner) or employing staff in order to mobilise data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applications for the program will open mid-March 2022. Keep an eye on our ALA news channels (Blog, twitter, facebook, LinkedIn) to find out when applications open.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"who-can-apply\"><strong>Who can apply?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re looking for institutions or biodiversity researchers who need help digitising historic physical records and mobilising data into the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no catch, as long as the records are biodiversity-related. This can be for any wild species in Australia \u2013 from koalas to cane toads, eucalypts to bioluminescent fungi, we want to know about it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data might be in paper field notes, or species in physical collections. Whatever it is, we\u2019ll be giving out grants to 6 institutions through both small ($20K) and large grants($50k).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering why! Well, available data = useful data \u2013 so by making historical data accessible, it can then be shared more widely and used by researchers, and to support biodiversity conservation efforts and decision-making.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-1024x576.png\" alt=\"colourful specimens in an insect collection\" class=\"wp-image-46503\" width=\"1005\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1005px) 100vw, 1005px\" \/><figcaption><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Image: Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC)<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"details-of-the-program\"><strong>Details of the program<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-apply\">How to apply<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The submission form will be available here from the 14th of March.

No, this program is for existing biodiversity species occurrence data only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q. If I receive a grant, can I use it to purchase equipment AND pay wages?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A. Yes, you can! For example, if you receive a grant for $20,000, you might budget to spend $10,000 on a camera, and $10,000 on wages for a research assistant to scan biodiversity speciments<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q. Does my data have to be completely analogue, such as handwritten notes or specimens?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A. No, it can be stored on computer, but it must not have been shared with the ALA before. For example, if you have some records from fieldwork in a spreadsheet, as long as it hasn&#8217;t otherwise been shared before, this would qualify. In this case the work would entail conversion of the data to the ALA Darwin Core standard. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"any-other-questions\">Any other questions?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Please <a href=\"mailto:outreach@ala.org.au\">email us<\/a> with any questions you have about the program.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you work in an institution with historic biodiversity data?

Despite the growth of women and gender-diverse people in STEM in recent years, a significant gender gap still remains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Australia, less than one quarter of STEM students at university and VET level are women, and five years after graduation, men with STEM qualifications are almost twice as likely to be working in a STEM-qualified occupation. Across all STEM industries, only 28% of workers are women, and even fewer are managers \u2013 just 23% of management positions are held by women (source: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.industry.gov.au\/news\/second-national-data-report-on-girls-and-women-in-stem\" target=\"_blank\">STEM Equity Monitor 2021<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate #February11 in our own ALA way, we asked our team to share about a woman in science they find inspiring. Compiling the responses into a short blog was not an easy task! We discussed the work of so many brilliant women \u2013 sharing links, books, podcasts and research papers around the office. Here is a small selection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"karlie-noon\"><strong>Karlie Noon<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By Olivia Torresan, Support Officer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karlie Noon is a Gamillaraay \/ Kamilaroi \/ Gomeroi woman from Tamworth, NSW. Her current research looks at investigating how the Milky Way galaxy finds new sources of hydrogen gas (which drives star formation). This research could potentially help inform us about the longevity of the galaxy we live within. In her spare time, Karlie has also contributed to researching Indigenous knowledge on moon halos \u2013 a light refraction phenomena that can aid in predicting rain events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/karlie2.png\" alt=\"&quot;&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-46371\" width=\"975\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/karlie2.png 700w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/karlie2-300x166.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" \/><figcaption><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Photo: ABC Me and SBS<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Karlie is the first Aboriginal woman to attain a double degree in mathematics and physics. She has since pursued a Masters of Astronomy (Advanced) and is currently undertaking a PhD at the Australian National University. She credits her drive to learn maths not to school, but to one of the many strong women in her life: her Aunty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first came across Karlie in my early undergraduate years when studying a joint philosophy and maths unit in Cosmology. My undergraduate was a double degree in philosophy and environmental science. Though the class didn\u2019t have an explicit focus on the connections between astronomy and ecology, I read about some of Karlie\u2019s work (some which did just that) when doing some research. It fascinated me. It\u2019s crazy to think that it wasn\u2019t until I arrived at university that I felt I resonated with a female figure in STEM. Like Karlie, I\u2019m a first-generation student. That said, I can only really imagine how further inspiring her work is for Indigenous women in STEM. She\u2019s carried on from her elders; her family \u2013 who have thousands of years of intricate astronomical knowledge, precursing the likes of Galileo and Newton. That, of which, Western science still struggles to acknowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbs.com.au\/topics\/voices\/culture\/article\/2020\/11\/05\/astronomer-and-astrophysicist-karlie-noon-opening-educational-pathways-aboriginal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SBS Voices article<\/a> on Karlie and her work<\/li><li>A short <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/buqMoaLrs0A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">video about Karlie\u2019s work<\/a> by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rsaa.anu.edu.au\/study\/student-profiles\/karlie-noon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Karlie\u2019s ANU profile<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"fernanda-werneck\"><strong>Fernanda Werneck<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By Jessica Fenker Antunes, Data Analyst\/R Programmer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/fernanda-1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"&quot;&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-46424\" width=\"475\" height=\"626\"\/><figcaption><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Photo: Werneck Lab<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Fernanda Werneck works in the heart of the Amazon Forest (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Amaz\u00f4nicas, Brazil), investigating how climate change can affect biodiversity, and the implications for conservation. Besides that, Fernanda promotes and values Women in Science, having published many articles and presented at conferences about the feminine presence in biology. Fernanda is affiliated with the Brazilian Academy of Science, and a member of the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentinscience.com\/english\">Parent in Science Brazil<\/a>\u201d movement.

It involves experiences of immersion in the forest, hoping to raise awareness and awaken feelings of environmental citizenship in favour of simply preserving biodiversity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met Dr Werneck during my Master at Universidade de Bras\u00edlia. At that time, she had just finished her PhD in the US and was moving back to Brazil. She taught me a lot about phylogenetic analyses and motivated me to pursue my research in biogeography and evolution. More than that, Fernanda is keen to support and discuss research and life with any student in the lab and maintain contact over the years. Personally, I find Fernanda inspiring as a Latina\/Brazilian woman to reach a prestigious position while supporting many other women and girls to pursue the same.

Impressively, she did this work independently of several leading experts (who had just been funded millions of dollars to do the same) after she had asked permission to try to decode a small chunk of the tree and they turned her down. It was a gutsy move for a PhD candidate to take on a project that was eventually compared directly to that of leading experts, but when the two final phylogenies were compared, they \u201cmatched almost perfectly\u201d!

My own research had nothing to do with ants, gut bacteria, or phylogenomics. Yet Corrie was an enigmatic speaker and a friendly presence. She was especially warm to students and gave some of the best advice I have received to this day on how to advocate and support gender and cultural diversity in STEM. Importantly, she showed me that you don\u2019t have to be a stereotypical academic scientist to succeed \u2013 one can still be exceptional while being fun, supportive, and very much themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edward O. Wilson, Corrie\u2019s PhD supervisor explains Corrie\u2019s disposition perfectly in his book <em>Letters to a Young Scientist<\/em>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere was no bravado in Corrie, no trace of overweening pride, no pretension. She was a quiet, serene enthusiast. As it turned out, she was also an open, helpful friend to fellow students and others around her.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hilariously, I was reading this book when I met Corrie and told her about this amazing PhD student in the book who independently created a phylogeny of all the ants\u2026not realising it was her!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You can read Corrie\u2019s profile on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.moreaulab.entomology.cornell.edu\/people\/corrie-moreau\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Moreau Lab<\/a> website, and also on the <a href=\"https:\/\/ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu\/corrie-moreau\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cornell<\/a> website.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"elinor-ostrom\"><strong>Elinor Ostrom<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By Peggy Newman, Team Lead &amp; Data Manager<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ostrom-15149-portrait-mini-2x-1.jpeg\" alt=\"&quot;&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-46367\" width=\"436\" height=\"656\"\/><figcaption><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Photo: U. Montan, source: The Nobel Foundation<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>My current STEM hero is Elinor Ostrom, the only woman to have ever won a Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. I\u2019m fascinated that her research delved into solutions for the \u201ctragedy of the commons,\u201d and found that there are ways communities can&nbsp;successfully care&nbsp;for common property like land and natural resources without exploiting&nbsp;and destroying&nbsp;them. She found a happy medium between privatisation and state&nbsp;regulation&nbsp;to effectively and efficiently manage natural resources, whereby the community that uses the resource manages it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m extremely moved by her work&nbsp;because the popular discourse of blaming our current environmental and social problems on human greed tends to point fingers at individuals without&nbsp;examining the systems that enable the problems. Through real examples, Ostrom\u2019s work&nbsp;examines how those systems can work better through community governance. Coming from a family of primary producers who rely heavily on environmental resources, I am unbelievably excited about this. In 2012, Time magazine named her as one of the most 100 influential people in the world. Sure we\u2019re not there yet, but Ostrom undoubtedly worked to make the world a better place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nobelprize.org\/prizes\/economic-sciences\/2009\/ostrom\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read more about Elinor\u2019s work in detail, and watch one of her lectures<\/a><\/li><li>If you\u2019re after a quick read, <a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/specials\/packages\/article\/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2111960,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Time<\/a> has a great page about Elinor<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"spotlight-on-a-girls-in-stem-initiative-robogals\"><strong>Spotlight on a girls in STEM initiative: Robogals<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Robogals is an international student-led organisation that hosts engineering and technology workshops in local communities, with a focus on girls in primary and secondary school.
