Shaw was an English naturalist and zoologist. His ground-breaking publication, <em>The Naturalist\u2019s Miscellany,<\/em> consists of 24 volumes published in monthly instalments (fascicles) between 1789 and 1813. It contains scientific descriptions (in both English and Latin) of over 1000 species that were sent to London from around the world in the late 1700s and early 1800s. It covers an impressive range of species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, spiders, shells, and other marine organisms. Each description is accompanied by a spectacular illustration by Frederick Polydore Nodder, or, in the later volumes, his son Richard. Unprecedented in its scope and depth, <em>The Naturalist\u2019s Miscellany<\/em> aimed to educate readers while highlighting the magnificence and diversity of nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the timing of this significant work, <em>The Naturalist\u2019s Miscellany<\/em> contains the first published scientific descriptions of many iconic Australian species, including (in 1790), the first scientific description of any species of kangaroo. At this time, the study of natural history was an esteemed academic pursuit backed by scientific rigour. George Shaw\u2019s descriptions contain obvious awe and sometimes scepticism as he struggles fit Australia\u2019s bizarre creatures into the current understanding of the natural world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Shaw&#8217;s description of the kangaroo, he notes the female is \u201cfurnished with a ventral pouch\u201d. And his wonder just builds from here. He says:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Kanguroo is a very anomalous and extraordinary quadruped\u2026It is a creature of surprising agility, and springs forwards, by leaping to so uncommon a height, and to so great a distance, as to outstrip the fleetest pursuit; the swiftest greyhound being easily and soon distanced by this wonderful quadruped.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"897\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2-1024x897.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48483\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2-1024x897.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2-300x263.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2-768x673.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2.png 1233w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Caption: The Great Kanguroo, <\/em>(Macropus giganteus)<em> [Pl. 33] in Shaw, George (1790) The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany (vol. 1) <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5962\/p.310685\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5962\/p.310685<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1792, Shaw introduced the echidna (the Porcupine Ant-Eater) to the wider world.

The specimen Shaw based his description on is in Natural History Museum in London. If you were to examine this specimen, you would see the cuts around the bill made by Shaw in his efforts to find stitches. He was convinced the specimen was a hoax; that the bill of a duck had been sewn onto the body of something like a water rat. Shaw\u2019s description of the platypus is one of only a few out of the 1000 that is accompanied by two plates. It seems that addition illustration \u2013 or perhaps proof \u2013 was required for those species that were truly perplexing. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany<\/em> left an indelible legacy on the field of natural history. It played a vital role in the development of zoology as a discipline, providing an extensive compilation of species, many of which had not been previously documented. Shaw&#8217;s meticulous observations, combined with the detailed illustrations, enabled future naturalists and scientists to study and identify species with greater precision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we commemorate the International Day for Biological Diversity, the significance of this publication, and the historic literature as a whole, resonates deeply. The world is currently facing an unprecedented loss of species due to various factors, including habitat destruction, climate change, and other human activities. Some of the species described in <em>The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany<\/em>, such as the Great Auk and the Dodo, are now extinct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"302\" height=\"471\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48486\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-4.jpg 302w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-4-192x300.jpg 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Caption: The Dodo,<\/em> (Didus ineptus)<em> [Pl. 123] in Shaw, George (1799) The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany (vol. 4) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biodiversitylibrary.org\/page\/44515507\">https:\/\/www.biodiversitylibrary.org\/page\/44515507<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These examples serve as reminders of the irreversible loss that can occur when species are not adequately protected and conserved.

Some notable studies of {galah}\u2019s previous iteration {ALA4R} include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/wr\/WR20070\">tracking the seasonal movement and impact of invasive buffalo across northern Australia<\/a>, estimating the total (and undiscovered) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/full\/10.1073\/pnas.2115329119\">number of trees on Earth<\/a>, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/researchsystem.canberra.edu.au\/ws\/portalfiles\/portal\/62608058\/Hemming_Kyle.pdf\">analysing native and exotic grass groups<\/a> with different carbon storing capacities (C3\/C4) and their relationship with varying environmental gradients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension of {galah} into <a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\">Python<\/a> expands the usability of the tool to allow users to retrieve data in a platform that they may be more familiar with. In 2023, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/meet-caitlin-an-ala-indigenous-internship-student-with-a-flare-for-coding\/\">Caitlin Ramsay<\/a> &#8211; an ALA Indigenous Internship student &#8211; was the first to use the Python extension of {galah} to <a href=\"https:\/\/labs.ala.org.au\/posts\/2023-04-28_plotting-invasive-species\/post.html\">understand the expansion of invasive species, both native and introduced, into Australia<\/a>. Such work could even be extended to other countries as the Python version of {galah} hosts, not only the Australian, but also the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sibbr.gov.br\/\">Brazilian<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gbif.es\/\">Spanish<\/a> living atlases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\">access Galah 0.1.0 (Python) here<\/a>. It&#8217;s also now available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). Instructions on how to install, use and explore the features of this package are available at<a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\"> galah.ala.org.au\/Python<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\">Python extension of {galah}<\/a>, and discover helpful tips &amp; tricks for coding on <a href=\"https:\/\/labs.ala.org.au\/\">ALA Labs<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cane-toads-final-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48092\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cane-toads-final-1024x768.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cane-toads-final-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cane-toads-final-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cane-toads-final-1536x1152.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cane-toads-final-2048x1536.png 2048w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cane-toads-final-1920x1440.png 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cane-toads-final-640x480.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Map created by Caitlin Ramsay using the ALA Python extension of {galah}, showing Cane Toad&nbsp;<em>(Rhinella marina)<\/em> distribution across Australia each decade since their introduction.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve just launched an open-access Python extension for the Atlas of Living Australia\u2019s {galah} tool to help you better access our species data.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":48435,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48392"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48392"}],"version-history":[{"count":15,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48392\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48434,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48392\/revisions\/48434"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/48435"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48392"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48392"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48392"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":48348,"date":"2023-03-30T10:43:42","date_gmt":"2023-03-29T23:43:42","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=48348"},"modified":"2023-03-30T12:19:47","modified_gmt":"2023-03-30T01:19:47","slug":"ala-webinar-advances-in-genomics-and-biological-collections","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/ala-webinar-advances-in-genomics-and-biological-collections\/","title":{"rendered":"ALA Webinar: Advances in Genomics and Biological Collections"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collections specimens are valuable resources in genomics as they provide a historical record of the diversity of life on earth.
