Since its initial release in July, thousands of download requests have been made using <strong>galah<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new version (1.3.1) brings two exciting features to <strong>galah <\/strong>for the first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"range-queries-now-possible\"><strong>Range queries now possible<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, this version supports \u2018range queries\u2019; that is, the capacity to state that you want values that are above or below a particular value. This makes it simple to state that you want all records after a particular year, or above a particular elevation. Combined with the ability to specify Boolean queries (such as AND, OR, NOT), this version of <strong>galah <\/strong>is a major upgrade. See the \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/atlasoflivingaustralia.github.io\/galah\/reference\/select_filters.html\">select_filters<\/a>\u2019 page for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"search-taxonomic-data-stored-by-the-ala\"><strong>Search taxonomic data stored by the ALA<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, and more importantly, version 1.3.1 introduces the <strong>ala_taxonomy() <\/strong>function. This function provides a new way to search through the taxonomic hierarchy within the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxonomic information downloaded using <strong>ala_taxonomy()<\/strong> is now returned as a taxonomic tree. This capability enables users to search for which lower clades are contained within a specified taxon. For example, users can find all clades at the family rank that stem from the class \u201cMammalia\u201d. They can also search down to a number of other less formal taxonomic sub-ranks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxonomic trees preserve ranks within their data structure, offering new opportunities to create data visualisations that harness this information.

The major upgrade was possible due to our close partnership with GBIF \u2013 the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas of Living Australia is the Australian node of GBIF, an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world&#8217;s governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to biodiversity data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"collaboration\"><strong>Collaboration<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our systems upgrade is the result of more than 12 months of collaborative work between teams based in Australia, UK and Denmark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development teams established a software codebase shared by both teams and worked on a framework for genuinely open-source software development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe ALA and GBIF development teams worked so well together. There\u2019s a strong sense of trust and confidence in the skills of each team leading to individual contributions contributing to the larger whole.<\/p><p>Our teams know that accessible, high quality biodiversity data is improving research and environmental outcomes across the globe and that their efforts are integral to making this happen,\u201d said Joe Miller, executive secretary of GBIF and former research group leader at the Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research, CSIRO.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"major-upgrade-reaps-benefits-for-users\"><strong>Major upgrade reaps benefits for users<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"efficiency-and-effectiveness\"><strong>Efficiency and effectiveness<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new infrastructure, using GBIF\/ALA shared codebase, increases indexing speeds for the ALA, reduces its running costs, and reduces long-term technical debt. With the ALA&#8217;s infrastructure growing in excess of millions of biodiversity occurrence records annually, such efficiencies are critical. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Javier Molina, ALA\u2019s Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project Lead, was pleased to report that users have noticed the system is more responsive, particularly when searching species data, using map-based navigation, and using the Spatial Portal (ALA\u2019s analytical tool).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cPrior to the upgrade, we were experiencing some unscheduled outages every month. Since the project went live in June, we haven\u2019t received any reports of unscheduled outages. The system has also coped well with high peaks of utilisation,\u201d said Javier.<\/p><p>\u201cWe recently ingested a dataset from eBird Australia of more than 20 million records, this went smoothy and without issue. A dataset that large would have created lots of headaches for us in the old system.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"consistency-is-key\"><strong>Consistency is key<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency between the ALA, GBIF and other biodiversity infrastructures is another component of the recent upgrade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many users of the ALA also frequently access data through GBIF. For these users, the benefits of a shared infrastructure are clear. Shared approaches to processing biodiversity data eliminate potential sources of confusion for users. For example, if there are consistent flags and interpretations, users become comfortable and proficient using multiple platforms. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"international-living-atlases-will-also-benefit-from-upgrade\"><strong>International Living Atlases will also benefit from upgrade<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Software originally developed by the Atlas of Living Australia team is increasingly used across the GBIF network. There are now 27 installations around the world. Some of these are national biodiversity databases and some are thematic, regional or institutional instances. The International Living Atlases is a collaborative global community that supports developers who implement the open-source platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cOur collaborative work with GBIF has built social capital in the global community, and it is an excellent entry point for the International Living Atlases community to jump onboard,\u201d said Javier.<br><br>\u201cCompletion of this first phase now makes it possible for the international community to co-develop new features and work on other mutual areas of interest and concern, including a shared registry and improved handling of sampling-event datasets.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Core-infrastructure-upgrade-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44911\" width=\"919\" height=\"768\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"technical-details\"><strong>Technical details<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AWS: virtual infrastructure from AWS performs better and is more affordable.
