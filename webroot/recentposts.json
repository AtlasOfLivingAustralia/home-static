Why is the field of taxonomy so important to the ALA\u2019s work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taxonomy provides the mechanism to identify and classify organisms. It\u2019s vital to the ALA because the name of the species observed is one of the three core pieces of information (with location and date) that is required to create a species occurrence record. It\u2019s estimated that only about a third of the +700,000 species found in Australia have been given a scientific name.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aggregating species data is reliant on the records being accurately identified at the lowest resolution of the taxonomic hierarchy possible. Identifying organisms in a particular place is important to making decisions about natural resource management and understanding changing climates.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taxonomy provides a way to both get data into the ALA and to search for data. All incoming data points are matched to the \u2018taxonomic backbone\u2019 or placed into the classification hierarchy in the ALA infrastructure.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It\u2019s important to be aware that taxonomic names are not static and are continually being revised. This is because researchers learn more (through techniques such as genetic analysis) to better understand how to delineate species. The ALA is on a constant journey to update our taxonomic backbone, to ensure our structure is as current and accurate as possible.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Tell us about taxonomy in your career?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I wouldn\u2019t call myself a taxonomist, both my honours and PhD projects were in zoophysiology rather than taxonomy, but I have been around taxonomy since I started working at Museums Victoria after my PhD in 1995. Earlier than that, I\u2019ve had an interest in collecting biological things since I was a child. I would collect shells at the beach, sorting, identifying, and labelling them. Even as a nine-year-old, I would pack a bag full of books alongside my beach towel, so that I could identify my finds. I had a logbook for recording what I collected each year, so I guess that\u2019s where it started!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I think that for many people, wanting to know what an animal or plant is called is their first interaction with taxonomy \u2013 even if they wouldn\u2019t put it that way. At Museums Victoria, I led a fantastic team to develop&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/museumsvictoria.com.au\/apps\/national-field-guide-apps\/\"><em>The National Field Guide<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;apps project.

TDWG sets and evolves international standards such as <a href=\"https:\/\/dwc.tdwg.org\/\">Darwin Core<\/a> that make the work that ALA and our partners do possible. In addition to TDWG\u2019s focus on biodiversity informatics, science applications of biodiversity data will feature prominently at the conference, so we warmly invite you to get involved \u2013 who doesn\u2019t enjoy a major science event on the Hobart waterfront?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the ALA has been proud of its ongoing partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gbif.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">GBIF<\/a>) where we\u2019ve gained enormous value from relationships with the international GBIF network. At last year\u2019s GBIF Governing Board meeting in Brussels, the ALA and our biological collections partners in CSIRO successfully bid to host the 2023 meeting of the Governing Board in Australia. The meeting will follow directly from the TDWG event and will be hosted in Canberra in mid-October. It\u2019s been 20 years since Australia hosted a meeting of the Governing Board and we are excited to welcome our international partners.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I\u2019d like to reflect on a remarkable experience our team had over recent months hosting two Indigenous Internship students. We welcomed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/meet-caitlin-an-ala-indigenous-internship-student-with-a-flare-for-coding\/\">Caitlin Ramsay <\/a>(University of New South Wales) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/diving-into-dingo-data-with-amos-smith\/\">Amos Smith<\/a> (University of Western Australia) who partnered with our Science and Decision Support team over the summer period on two applied projects. As a team, we gained so much from their involvement in our work, and it was rewarding to provide them with some insight into the role of national research infrastructure in Australia\u2019s science and innovation system. For me, it highlighted the value of bringing diversity and new ideas into a team, and the responsibility more established institutions such as the ALA have in supporting our upcoming research infrastructure specialists.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy our March newsletter. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the March 2023 edition of our newsletter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48177"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48177"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48177\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48324,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48177\/revisions\/48324"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48177"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48177"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48177"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":48107,"date":"2023-03-08T08:40:15","date_gmt":"2023-03-07T21:40:15","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=48107"},"modified":"2023-03-08T08:40:15","modified_gmt":"2023-03-07T21:40:15","slug":"celebrating-ala-women-in-stem","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/celebrating-ala-women-in-stem\/","title":{"rendered":"Celebrating ALA women in STEM"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.churchilltrust.com.au\/\">Churchill Fellowship Trust<\/a>&nbsp;is a highly competitive awards program that provides opportunities for individuals to travel overseas to gain new knowledge and perspectives in their field of work.

I\u2019ve never really known what I wanted to do, but I\u2019ve let my passion and interest in the environment shape my career. That\u2019s resulted in some amazing experiences from aerial moose surveys in Nova Scotia for my Bachelor of Science (Honours) work, modelling wombat presence on the Snowy Mountains Highway for my PhD and working in semi-arid ecology. After university, I became interested in the science-policy interface and joined the New South Wales Environment department to understand science translation. I was lucky enough to have several roles; one of which led me to thinking about how to engage a broader cohort of people in science via citizen science to drive impact.
