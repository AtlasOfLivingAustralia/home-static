First, the vision commits to supporting new biodiversity data types, including from advances in genomics-based biodiversity identification, biodiversity survey data, and data emerging from sensor networks all of which are becoming increasingly important for our users. The ALA also recognises the fundamental role biological collections provide in supporting science and accelerating the digitisation of physical specimens to enable digital access. This aspiration aligns closely with the collections step change identified in the NRI roadmap around collections. Finally, the ALA Decadal Vision details the new sectors we will prioritise, and partnership models the ALA will adopt moving forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"work-is-already-underway\"><strong>Work is already underway<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A decade may seem a long time but the ALA has already commenced pathfinder activities across several decadal priorities, a number of which appear on our <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/current-projects\/\" target=\"_blank\">current projects pages<\/a>. Our recently announced <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/abdmp\/\" target=\"_blank\">data mobilisation program<\/a> will also provide the foundation to support any further investment in accelerating the digitisation of Australia\u2019s biological collections.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We encourage you to read our decadal vision, particularly in the context of future science and decision-making drivers.

She specialises in eco-physiology and morphology, thermal biology and CT scanning. She completed her Bachelor and Masters at Comahue National University (Argentina) on habitat use in geckos, and research at the National University of Cuyo (Argentina) on the thermal ecophysiology of iguanids. Roc\u00edo worked for 6 years as a Research Assistant with Mike Kearney (University of Melbourne) and Christy Hipsley (University of Melbourne\/Museum Victoria) working on eco-physio-morphology and conservation of Australian lizards. As part of a Monash University ARC Linkage Project with Museums Victoria and other Australian Museums, she is currently CT scanning all Australian lizard species to understand the evolutionary morphology pathways that make Australia the most lizard-diverse country in the world!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright\"><img src=\"https:\/\/events.csiro.au\/~\/media\/Images\/Events\/E-ALADHC-220316\/EmilyRoycroft-135px.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=25301C35B33F84634E9F1483BBADC82EF3A8C55E\" alt=\"Dr Emily Roycroft\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"arve-solland-ecocommons\">Emily Roycroft | ANU<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Emily Roycroft is an evolutionary biologist and postdoctoral researcher at the Australian National University.
