The platform supports both ad-hoc species occurrence records as well as structured citizen science-led surveys (bioblitzes and photographic competitions). Data submissions can be made in less than a minute using the NatureMapr App (available through mobile app for <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/au\/app\/naturemapr\/id1042299523\">iOS<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=naturemapr.mobile.droid&amp;hl=en_AU&amp;gl=US\">Android<\/a>) or through the NatureMapr website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NatureMapr\u2019s AI based non-human moderator works together with its community of expert human moderators to quickly provide expert identification of submissions to users. From there, verified data is automatically passed through to the ALA as well as respective state and local government biodiversity databases as open data. The work of data partners like NatureMapr helps to bridge the gap between citizen science observations and driving on-ground research to allow easy discoverability and visibility of Australian biodiversity data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Naturemapr-logo.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48195\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Naturemapr-logo.png 400w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Naturemapr-logo-300x75.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NatureMapr is a data partner of the ALA, contributing verified citizen scientist biodiversity records to support the awareness and knowledge of species in local areas. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":48196,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48194"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48194"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48194\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48216,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48194\/revisions\/48216"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/48196"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48194"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48194"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48194"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":48148,"date":"2023-02-21T09:48:55","date_gmt":"2023-02-20T22:48:55","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=48148"},"modified":"2023-02-21T09:48:55","modified_gmt":"2023-02-20T22:48:55","slug":"diving-into-dingo-data-with-amos-smith","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/diving-into-dingo-data-with-amos-smith\/","title":{"rendered":"Diving into Dingo data with Amos Smith"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>We sat down with Amos Smith, one of Atlas of Living Australia&#8217;s (ALA) Indigenous Interns.

At first, I wanted to go straight into work once I finished my undergraduate degree, but now, I\u2019m considering completing either a Masters or PhD in something related to environmental science. I\u2019ve always had a strong connection to the land and ocean as well as a curiosity for the natural world. It became clearer to me as I got older that an environmental science degree would foster these values of mine and potentially let me make an impact.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: What made you apply for the Indigenous Studentship Internship program?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I heard about ALA internships from some friends at UNSW who participated in another internship program. From there I investigated whether the ALA offered internships over the summer and stumbled upon the Indigenous Studentship program. I applied because I wanted to see what it was like to apply the skills I\u2019ve learned at university in industry.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Q: What did your ALA internship project focus on?<br><em>My project focused on invasive species and how they have moved around over time. At first, I was interested in species&#8217; ranges shifting as a way to cope with climate change. This then led into this idea of changing species distributions and how quickly invasive species can spread within Australia. I also helped with the galah python package development which involved writing tests, finding bugs and helping to design its website.<\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: What was a new skill that that you learned through the program that you\u2019re proud of and what were some challenges that you faced during your project?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Coming into this internship I had never really done any data visualisation before. Now I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on how to code figures in Python and have been able to produce some aesthetic plots that I\u2019m super proud of.  While coding my data visualisations, I ran into a lot of bugs which is always challenging as sometimes it would take an entire day to try fix. I also was using Python to make data visualisations while the rest of the team predominantly used R. This meant I had to figure out a lot of the bugs on my own which was challenging but also a useful skill to develop.<\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: Tell us about your highlight of the internship program? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The highlight of the internship for me would definitely have to be the people I worked with.
