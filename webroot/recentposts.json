Tuttle CC BY NC&nbsp;<\/em>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the difficulty of accessing restricted data on species has created barriers for research, environmental <a>assessmen<\/a>t and conservation. Data on species has been modified, withheld or shared based on inconsistent organisational polices. The <a>National Framework <\/a>is the first of its kind, jointly developed by the Atlas of Living Australia, the Australian Research Data Commons, all the government environmental agencies in Australia, herbaria, fauna collections, EcoCommons Australia and the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing the precise locations of restricted<a> access <\/a>species potentially risks disturbance, harm or exploitation. Therefore, access to some species information is limited, accessible only to data custodians and approved data users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Framework outlines the principles to guide data custodians and users in the sharing of restricted access species data responsibly and appropriately. By adopting a nationally consistent evidence-based approach to managing restricted access species data, the National Framework aim to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>promote responsible data-sharing practices<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>give data custodians the confidence to safely share restricted access species data<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>assist data custodians to maintain the consistency and quality of data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cBirdLife Australia has long upheld a restricted access policy for sensitive species data as a basis for our citizen science work. This gives contributors the confidence that sharing their data will not put species at risk, while still allowing for its use in conservation. We are excited to now have a nationally consistent framework for sensitive species data sharing, which will massively increase the use and impact of bird and other species data in science and conservation\u201d said<\/em> Dr Golo Maurer, BirdLife Citizen Science Program Leader.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Restricted Access Species Data Service (RASDS) for Australia<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new RASDS allows researchers and other trusted data users to request restricted access species data from all participating data custodians in Australia via a central point. &nbsp;The service allows data custodians a way of managing and storing request workflows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cRASDS seeks to remove a major barrier to the flow of species data by standardising the way we describe and exchange sensitive species data<\/em>\u201d said Ron Avery, STL Biodiversity Information Systems Science, Economics and Insight Division, NSW Dept&nbsp;of Planning and Environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Partners:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These products were developed as part of a collaborative project between the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/#tab_pane-C\">Atlas of Living Australia<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/ardc.edu.au\">Australian Research Data Commons<\/a> (ARDC), the Australian Government, state and territory governments, conservation agencies, museums, and herbaria, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecocommons.org.au\/\">EcoCommons<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/wabsi.org.au\/\">Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more, visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rasd.org.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RASD webpage<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Launching the National Framework for the Sharing of Restricted Access Species Data and the Restricted Access Species Data Service for Australia<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":48569,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[170,11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48408"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48408"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48408\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48571,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48408\/revisions\/48571"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/48569"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48408"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48408"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48408"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":48521,"date":"2023-06-20T15:13:57","date_gmt":"2023-06-20T05:13:57","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=48521"},"modified":"2023-06-20T15:13:57","modified_gmt":"2023-06-20T05:13:57","slug":"directors-update-june-2023","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/directors-update-june-2023\/","title":{"rendered":"Director&#8217;s Update &#8211; June 2023"},"content":{"rendered":"<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-medium is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Andre-cropped-218x300.jpg\" alt=\"Profile shot of Andre Zerger\" class=\"wp-image-48178\" width=\"225\" height=\"318\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dr Andre Zerger, ALA Director<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Welcome to the June 2023 edition of our ALA newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biological collections play an important role in understanding trends in biodiversity life sciences.

The workshop &#8211; <em>\u2018Towards a national approach to biological collections\u2019 <\/em>\u2013 brought together experts to explore current capabilities, emerging research drivers and key components that are required to support biological collections in Australia. Having our partners from across the nation meet together <a>highlighted the maturity and cohesiveness of our sector<\/a>, as well as the opportunities for international collaboration and improving data connections to deliver greater scientific benefit.

Shaw was an English naturalist and zoologist. His ground-breaking publication, <em>The Naturalist\u2019s Miscellany,<\/em> consists of 24 volumes published in monthly instalments (fascicles) between 1789 and 1813. It contains scientific descriptions (in both English and Latin) of over 1000 species that were sent to London from around the world in the late 1700s and early 1800s. It covers an impressive range of species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, spiders, shells, and other marine organisms. Each description is accompanied by a spectacular illustration by Frederick Polydore Nodder, or, in the later volumes, his son Richard. Unprecedented in its scope and depth, <em>The Naturalist\u2019s Miscellany<\/em> aimed to educate readers while highlighting the magnificence and diversity of nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the timing of this significant work, <em>The Naturalist\u2019s Miscellany<\/em> contains the first published scientific descriptions of many iconic Australian species, including (in 1790), the first scientific description of any species of kangaroo. At this time, the study of natural history was an esteemed academic pursuit backed by scientific rigour. George Shaw\u2019s descriptions contain obvious awe and sometimes scepticism as he struggles fit Australia\u2019s bizarre creatures into the current understanding of the natural world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Shaw&#8217;s description of the kangaroo, he notes the female is \u201cfurnished with a ventral pouch\u201d.

The specimen Shaw based his description on is in Natural History Museum in London. If you were to examine this specimen, you would see the cuts around the bill made by Shaw in his efforts to find stitches. He was convinced the specimen was a hoax; that the bill of a duck had been sewn onto the body of something like a water rat. Shaw\u2019s description of the platypus is one of only a few out of the 1000 that is accompanied by two plates. It seems that addition illustration \u2013 or perhaps proof \u2013 was required for those species that were truly perplexing. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany<\/em> left an indelible legacy on the field of natural history. It played a vital role in the development of zoology as a discipline, providing an extensive compilation of species, many of which had not been previously documented. Shaw&#8217;s meticulous observations, combined with the detailed illustrations, enabled future naturalists and scientists to study and identify species with greater precision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we commemorate the International Day for Biological Diversity, the significance of this publication, and the historic literature as a whole, resonates deeply. The world is currently facing an unprecedented loss of species due to various factors, including habitat destruction, climate change, and other human activities. Some of the species described in <em>The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany<\/em>, such as the Great Auk and the Dodo, are now extinct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"302\" height=\"471\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48486\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-4.jpg 302w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-4-192x300.jpg 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Caption: The Dodo,<\/em> (Didus ineptus)<em> [Pl. 123] in Shaw, George (1799) The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany (vol. 4) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biodiversitylibrary.org\/page\/44515507\">https:\/\/www.biodiversitylibrary.org\/page\/44515507<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These examples serve as reminders of the irreversible loss that can occur when species are not adequately protected and conserved.
