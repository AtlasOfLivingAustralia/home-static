This makes it easier than ever to find, download and analyse information on Australian biodiversity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We created <em>galah <\/em>to support users who need to access ALA data in bulk. Many researchers routinely use programming languages to request data, rather than manually navigating our website. For the biodiversity research community, the most commonly used programming language is called \u2018R\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>R is a useful programming language by itself; but it\u2019s most valuable feature is the ability to write and share bundles of software \u2013 called \u2018packages\u2019 \u2013 which users can install to achieve specific tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>galah<\/em> enables ALA users to locate and download occurrence records, taxonomic information, and associated media such as images or sounds. It allows users to directly integrate data from the ALA into their analyses in R.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"naming-ala4rs-successor\">Naming ALA4R&#8217;s successor<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We chose to call our new software \u2018galah\u2019 for a few reasons. First, it is an iconic Australian species that many people will be familiar with. Second, the word galah already contains the acronym \u2018ALA\u2019. Finally, a poll of users on social media chose <em>galah<\/em> over other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This package is the successor to the earlier <em>ALA4R<\/em>, which has been available for R users since 2014. <em>galah <\/em>provides an improved and simplified user experience to <em>ALA4R<\/em>, while still providing the same core functionality. <em>ALA4R <\/em>will be maintained but not actively developed while users transition to <em>galah<\/em>, and we encourage users to make the switch as soon as practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EcoCommons-training_galah.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44816\" width=\"400\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EcoCommons-training_galah.png 650w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EcoCommons-training_galah-300x240.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><figcaption>ALA developer Matilda Stevenson (bottom right) presents galah to an EcoCommons Software Carpentry workshop in June 2021.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"early-adoption-and-recent-updates\">Early adoption and recent updates<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we developed <em>galah<\/em>, early adopters have been testing the package extensively in classes and research projects around the country.

The B&amp;B Highway Program \u2013 \u00a0spearheaded by Dr Judy Friedlander of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ps.org.au\/\">PlantingSeeds Projects<\/a>, aims to provide habitat for birds, bees, butterflies and biodiversity through native plantings and the installation of pollinator habitats such as native stingless beehives, nesting boxes and insect hotels. The program is now in more than 50 schools and community locations throughout NSW and is making inroads in other states throughout Australia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"842\" height=\"399\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44821\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_1.jpg 842w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_1-300x142.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_1-768x364.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px\" \/><figcaption><em>Schools learn more about pollinators and habitat through participation in the B&amp;B Highway Program which also offers indoor and outdoor, and theoretical and practical teachings about biodiversity.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The June launch celebrated the partnership of CSIRO\u2019s Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), the Australian Citizen Science Association (ACSA) and the B&amp;B Highway in enabling citizen science data to flow from the program into the ALA. The aim for the program is to contribute valuable pollinator and plant data so the data is freely available for anyone to use. The program has been set up on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/projects\/b-b-highway-nsw\">iNaturalist<\/a> so that all participating schools can see their observations under the umbrella B&amp;B Highway Project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the chill, the launch kicked off with a search of the garden at Ryde East Public School, where a number of young pollinator enthusiasts from different schools had been assembled. While we didn\u2019t find many pollinators, it showed the importance of seasonal sampling for true indication of pollinator diversity. Speeches, snacks and celebrations then followed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"840\" height=\"630\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2.jpg 840w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption><em>B&amp;B Highway participants looking for pollinators on a cold June day in Sydney<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone interested in finding out more about the B&amp;B Highway, and its educational resources, habitat constructions and the citizen science component <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ps.org.au\/bb-highway-school-info\">click here<\/a>.
