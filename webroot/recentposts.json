Shaw was an English naturalist and zoologist. His ground-breaking publication, <em>The Naturalist\u2019s Miscellany,<\/em> consists of 24 volumes published in monthly instalments (fascicles) between 1789 and 1813. It contains scientific descriptions (in both English and Latin) of over 1000 species that were sent to London from around the world in the late 1700s and early 1800s. It covers an impressive range of species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, spiders, shells, and other marine organisms. Each description is accompanied by a spectacular illustration by Frederick Polydore Nodder, or, in the later volumes, his son Richard. Unprecedented in its scope and depth, <em>The Naturalist\u2019s Miscellany<\/em> aimed to educate readers while highlighting the magnificence and diversity of nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the timing of this significant work, <em>The Naturalist\u2019s Miscellany<\/em> contains the first published scientific descriptions of many iconic Australian species, including (in 1790), the first scientific description of any species of kangaroo. At this time, the study of natural history was an esteemed academic pursuit backed by scientific rigour. George Shaw\u2019s descriptions contain obvious awe and sometimes scepticism as he struggles fit Australia\u2019s bizarre creatures into the current understanding of the natural world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Shaw&#8217;s description of the kangaroo, he notes the female is \u201cfurnished with a ventral pouch\u201d. And his wonder just builds from here. He says:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Kanguroo is a very anomalous and extraordinary quadruped\u2026It is a creature of surprising agility, and springs forwards, by leaping to so uncommon a height, and to so great a distance, as to outstrip the fleetest pursuit; the swiftest greyhound being easily and soon distanced by this wonderful quadruped.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"897\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2-1024x897.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48483\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2-1024x897.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2-300x263.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2-768x673.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-2.png 1233w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Caption: The Great Kanguroo, <\/em>(Macropus giganteus)<em> [Pl. 33] in Shaw, George (1790) The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany (vol. 1) <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5962\/p.310685\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5962\/p.310685<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1792, Shaw introduced the echidna (the Porcupine Ant-Eater) to the wider world.

The specimen Shaw based his description on is in Natural History Museum in London. If you were to examine this specimen, you would see the cuts around the bill made by Shaw in his efforts to find stitches. He was convinced the specimen was a hoax; that the bill of a duck had been sewn onto the body of something like a water rat. Shaw\u2019s description of the platypus is one of only a few out of the 1000 that is accompanied by two plates. It seems that addition illustration \u2013 or perhaps proof \u2013 was required for those species that were truly perplexing. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany<\/em> left an indelible legacy on the field of natural history. It played a vital role in the development of zoology as a discipline, providing an extensive compilation of species, many of which had not been previously documented. Shaw&#8217;s meticulous observations, combined with the detailed illustrations, enabled future naturalists and scientists to study and identify species with greater precision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we commemorate the International Day for Biological Diversity, the significance of this publication, and the historic literature as a whole, resonates deeply. The world is currently facing an unprecedented loss of species due to various factors, including habitat destruction, climate change, and other human activities. Some of the species described in <em>The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany<\/em>, such as the Great Auk and the Dodo, are now extinct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"302\" height=\"471\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48486\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-4.jpg 302w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/BHL-4-192x300.jpg 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Caption: The Dodo,<\/em> (Didus ineptus)<em> [Pl. 123] in Shaw, George (1799) The Naturalist&#8217;s Miscellany (vol. 4) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biodiversitylibrary.org\/page\/44515507\">https:\/\/www.biodiversitylibrary.org\/page\/44515507<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These examples serve as reminders of the irreversible loss that can occur when species are not adequately protected and conserved.

However, getting data directly into your own custom analysis program &#8211; a valuable tool for researchers &#8211; previously hasn\u2019t been as straightforward. To bridge this gap, Matilda Stevenson, Martin Westgate, Dax Kellie and Peggy Newman created an ALA software package in the R programming language called {<a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/\">galah<\/a>}.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>{galah} has been designed to be an easy-to-access tool that helps coders, researchers, decision-makers, and citizen scientists better understand and visualise data in the ALA. For example, the <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-030-88800-8_48-1\">first publication citing {galah}<\/a> was just released, outlining the important need for conservation of marsupials in the north-eastern tropics of Australia. Some notable studies of {galah}\u2019s previous iteration {ALA4R} include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/wr\/WR20070\">tracking the seasonal movement and impact of invasive buffalo across northern Australia<\/a>, estimating the total (and undiscovered) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/full\/10.1073\/pnas.2115329119\">number of trees on Earth<\/a>, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/researchsystem.canberra.edu.au\/ws\/portalfiles\/portal\/62608058\/Hemming_Kyle.pdf\">analysing native and exotic grass groups<\/a> with different carbon storing capacities (C3\/C4) and their relationship with varying environmental gradients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension of {galah} into <a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\">Python<\/a> expands the usability of the tool to allow users to retrieve data in a platform that they may be more familiar with. In 2023, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/meet-caitlin-an-ala-indigenous-internship-student-with-a-flare-for-coding\/\">Caitlin Ramsay<\/a> &#8211; an ALA Indigenous Internship student &#8211; was the first to use the Python extension of {galah} to <a href=\"https:\/\/labs.ala.org.au\/posts\/2023-04-28_plotting-invasive-species\/post.html\">understand the expansion of invasive species, both native and introduced, into Australia<\/a>. Such work could even be extended to other countries as the Python version of {galah} hosts, not only the Australian, but also the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sibbr.gov.br\/\">Brazilian<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gbif.es\/\">Spanish<\/a> living atlases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\">access Galah 0.1.0 (Python) here<\/a>.

It is ideal for researchers, practitioners, and anyone interested in the latest developments in genomics and biological collections, and the mobilisation of these data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ALA webinar: Advances in Genomics and Biological Collections\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YLaBiSQkOlM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This webinar took place at 1.00pm AEDT, Tuesday 28 March 2023, with 170 live viewers in attendance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:27px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"speakers\">Speakers<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"135\" height=\"180\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/erin-hahn.png\" alt=\"&quot;&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-48351\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arve-solland-ecocommons\">Erin Hahn | Australian National Wildlife Collection (CSIRO)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Hahn is a postdoctoral fellow and conservation geneticist at the Australian National Wildlife Collection at CSIRO.

Why is the field of taxonomy so important to the ALA\u2019s work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taxonomy provides the mechanism to identify and classify organisms. It\u2019s vital to the ALA because the name of the species observed is one of the three core pieces of information (with location and date) that is required to create a species occurrence record. It\u2019s estimated that only about a third of the +700,000 species found in Australia have been given a scientific name.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aggregating species data is reliant on the records being accurately identified at the lowest resolution of the taxonomic hierarchy possible. Identifying organisms in a particular place is important to making decisions about natural resource management and understanding changing climates.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taxonomy provides a way to both get data into the ALA and to search for data. All incoming data points are matched to the \u2018taxonomic backbone\u2019 or placed into the classification hierarchy in the ALA infrastructure.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It\u2019s important to be aware that taxonomic names are not static and are continually being revised. This is because researchers learn more (through techniques such as genetic analysis) to better understand how to delineate species. The ALA is on a constant journey to update our taxonomic backbone, to ensure our structure is as current and accurate as possible.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Tell us about taxonomy in your career?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I wouldn\u2019t call myself a taxonomist, both my honours and PhD projects were in zoophysiology rather than taxonomy, but I have been around taxonomy since I started working at Museums Victoria after my PhD in 1995. Earlier than that, I\u2019ve had an interest in collecting biological things since I was a child. I would collect shells at the beach, sorting, identifying, and labelling them. Even as a nine-year-old, I would pack a bag full of books alongside my beach towel, so that I could identify my finds. I had a logbook for recording what I collected each year, so I guess that\u2019s where it started!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I think that for many people, wanting to know what an animal or plant is called is their first interaction with taxonomy \u2013 even if they wouldn\u2019t put it that way. At Museums Victoria, I led a fantastic team to develop&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/museumsvictoria.com.au\/apps\/national-field-guide-apps\/\"><em>The National Field Guide<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;apps project.

I was very proud to start the BHL project in Australia and am lucky to have travelled all over the world with literature.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"657\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BHL-The-Mammals-of-Australia-scan-by-the-Biodiversity-Heritage-Library-n117-w1150-26679138504-1024x657.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a ring-tailed possum\" class=\"wp-image-48337\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BHL-The-Mammals-of-Australia-scan-by-the-Biodiversity-Heritage-Library-n117-w1150-26679138504-1024x657.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BHL-The-Mammals-of-Australia-scan-by-the-Biodiversity-Heritage-Library-n117-w1150-26679138504-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BHL-The-Mammals-of-Australia-scan-by-the-Biodiversity-Heritage-Library-n117-w1150-26679138504-768x493.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BHL-The-Mammals-of-Australia-scan-by-the-Biodiversity-Heritage-Library-n117-w1150-26679138504-1536x986.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BHL-The-Mammals-of-Australia-scan-by-the-Biodiversity-Heritage-Library-n117-w1150-26679138504-2048x1314.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/BHL-The-Mammals-of-Australia-scan-by-the-Biodiversity-Heritage-Library-n117-w1150-26679138504-1920x1232.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>From the Australian Biodiversity Heritage Library, The Mammals of Australia, London, Printed by Taylor and Francis, pub. by the author,1863.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I am the current Chair of the international organisation called Biodiversity Information Standards (<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tdwg.org\/\"><em>TDWG<\/em><\/a><em>) which develops and maintains the standard for&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/dwc.tdwg.org\/\"><em>Darwin Core<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;(the international standard for sharing biological data).
