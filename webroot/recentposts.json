Our journey began by hosting this year\u2019s annual meeting of the biodiversity data standards group <a href=\"https:\/\/tdwg2023.zohobackstage.com.au\/TDWG2023\">TDWG<\/a> in Hobart from October 9<sup>th<\/sup> to 13<sup>th<\/sup>. The event welcomed 166 participants from 26 countries (with 143 joining virtually) to present, learn and connect. We are grateful to those who continue the work of TDWG and biodiversity data standards. The TDWG-maintained Darwin Core standard has underpinned so many of the world&#8217;s biodiversity data systems, including the ALA, and ensures interoperable biodiversity data can move freely across platforms and borders. Events such as the TDWG annual meeting are fundamental in supporting the evolution of the standard and learning about the biodiversity science and applications it enables. <br><br>TDWG was a timely precursor to our next series of events hosted in Canberra and framed around the two-day Governing Board meeting of the <a href=\"https:\/\/gb30.gbif.org\/\">Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).<\/a> Australia last hosted the fourth Governing Board meeting (GB04) in 2002 at the National Academy of Sciences and then welcomed 18 countries to Canberra. 21 years later, we hosted 45 people from 30 countries at the National Portrait Gallery and CSIRO (with a further 28 participants joining online from 12 countries) to govern, support and grow the GBIF network. We were pleased to be joined by the Honourable Minister for the Environment and Water Tanya Plibersek at the gala dinner hosted at the National Museum of Australia. <a href=\"https:\/\/minister.dcceew.gov.au\/plibersek\/speeches\/speech-global-diversity-information-facility-gala-dinner\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/minister.dcceew.gov.au\/plibersek\/speeches\/speech-global-diversity-information-facility-gala-dinner\">The Minister&#8217;s address<\/a> affirmed the importance of data in supporting national and international biodiversity policy priorities and the ALA looks forward to working with our international and national partners to support these. <br><br>Hosting this series of international meetings highlights the leadership role that Australia plays, and the ALA is grateful to the individuals and teams that have put such a strong foundation in place over more than a decade. These partnerships also highlight the importance of international collaboration in improving the national biodiversity data landscape, and ultimately our ability to understand, conserve and enhance the world\u2019s biodiversity. I\u2019m grateful to our team and our fellow CSIRO colleagues who played such an important role in hosting and welcoming our international guests to Australia.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"

This means that you can continue to leverage your existing accounts from trusted identity providers such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/aaf.edu.au\/\">Australian Access Federation<\/a> (AAF), eliminating the need to create another username and password \u2013 making it quicker and easier to access the ALA for existing AAF users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"scalability-and-integration\"><strong>Scalability and Integration<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the number of records in the ALA grows, we ensure that our systems are flexible and scalable. OIDC allows us to integrate with a variety of web applications and evolve alongside other technical advancements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaboration is also a big part of what we do at the ALA, so we can continue to make even more data findable and accessible. With the growing adoption of OIDC, integration is made easier with our data partners and other collaborators. For example, we are working with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tern.org.au\/\">TERN<\/a> to integrate OIDC, making it quicker and easier for our <a href=\"https:\/\/fieldcapture.ala.org.au\/\">MERIT<\/a> users to sign in and submit data to the MERIT system using the TERN Monitor application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summary\">Summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The adoption of OIDC authentication represents a significant milestone in the ALA\u2019s ongoing commitment to data security, performance, and user experience.

They lay bright green eggs, with dads stepping up to be in charge of incubation and chick rearing. Once the eggs hatch, baby cassowaries can walk almost immediately with their strong back legs.

Cassowaries are notorious for communicating through deep rumbles, hisses and grunting sounds. Cassowaries use various vocalisations to communicate through their dense rainforest habitats. If you hear a cassowary calling, make sure you keep your distance. Equipped with a razor-sharp beak, talons and a particularly territorial nature, cassowaries are more than capable of tearing through flesh if they feel threatened. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keystone species<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cassowaries are \u2018keystone species\u2019 &#8211; species which has a disproportionately important role in their natural ecosystems. In rainforest habitats across northern QLD, cassowaries play a critical role in dispersing many native seeds through fragmented rainforest landscapes. Due to their large size, cassowaries can swallow fruits and other plants whole, digest the pulp and excrete seeds intact in dung piles (aka natural fertilisers). This ability to disperse large seeds helps to maintain healthy ecosystems by promoting vegetation regeneration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better illustrate how cassowaries support native plant dispersal across rainforest ecosystems, Callum and Shandiya from the ALA Science and Decision Support team have created an interactive map. The map shows 15 native plant species across the QLD wet tropics against cassowary records in the ALA!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\">Check out the interactive map!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"534\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1024x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48855\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1024x534.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-300x156.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-768x400.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1536x801.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-2048x1068.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1920x1001.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about native seeds in tropical areas, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ath.org.au\/\">Australian Topical Herbarium<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#WorldCassowaryDay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Celebrating #WorldCassowaryDay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":48857,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48809"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48856,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809\/revisions\/48856"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/48857"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48809"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48809"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48809"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":48740,"date":"2023-08-25T10:42:56","date_gmt":"2023-08-25T00:42:56","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=48740"},"modified":"2023-08-25T10:42:56","modified_gmt":"2023-08-25T00:42:56","slug":"ala-national-science-week-2023-recordings","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/ala-national-science-week-2023-recordings\/","title":{"rendered":"ALA National Science Week 2023 recordings"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate National Science Week 2023, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) hosted three free virtual events.

One of the most effective tools for protecting our native biodiversity is having access to information that shows where species are and how their populations are changing over time. Taxonomic groups like invertebrates, fungi and plants are underrepresented in species occurrence records, therefore the number of identified threatened species from these groups is thought to be much higher than current reported figures.
