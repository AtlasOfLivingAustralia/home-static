They used it to reconstruct near-complete mitochondrial genomes, a first using eggshells of non-ratite birds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, a team from ANWC and the Australian National University announced DNA can be extracted from very small eggshells held in museum collections without causing damage to the integrity or appearance of the specimen. The team demonstrated how their new sampling technique can be used to confirm the identity of unknown specimens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the world there are nearly 5 million eggshell specimens held in natural history collections. Many were collected by hobbyists in the past, before egg collecting was made illegal in most countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-1024x1007.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44538\" width=\"309\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-1024x1007.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-300x295.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-768x755.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO.png 1144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" \/><figcaption>Eggs specimens shown before (left) and after (right) drilling to extract DNA for this study.

But bird eggshells often lack metadata because the eggs of different species can look very similar,\u201d said lead author Alicia Grealy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn this study we examined 45 different eggshell specimens from ANWC that lacked metadata. We compared different sampling methods, such as swabbing the surface of eggshells, but ultimately optimised a drilling technique to retrieve eggshell powder. This provided us with sufficient DNA to identify the species while keeping the specimen intact,\u201d Alicia said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team cross-checked the species IDs they generated by using the Atlas of Living Australia to compare the morphology of each egg specimen with published reference photographs of that taxon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe then put the method to the test on a clutch of eggs in ANWC that purportedly were of the extinct Paradise Parrot,\u201d Alicia said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:5cc6c8d2-50dc-4c9f-9b12-5423b6da6f18\">Paradise Parrot (<em>Psephotellus pulcherrimus<\/em><\/a>) was listed as extinct in 1927. It lived in south-east Queensland and laid its nondescript white eggs inside termite mounds. Collected in 1967, the clutch of eggs had been identified as belonging to the Paradise Parrot and this has been contested for more than 50 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Parrots_egg_ANWC-CSIRO.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44528\" width=\"368\" height=\"237\"\/><figcaption>Egg specimens are valuable records of where and when birds have bred in changing environments and can inform how their distributions are changing.

From there, I\u2019ve been on this journey and found out more about bees than I ever expected!\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her quest for more information, Liz contacted Entomologist Juanita Rodriguez at CSIRO\u2019s Australian National Insect Collection, who confirmed the sighting was pretty rare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a rare event Liz captured and she took an excellent photo. &nbsp;Bees release liquid waste called uric acid, but they release it in such small amounts so it\u2019s unusual to witness it \u2013 and images like this are rare,\u201d said Juanita.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uric acid is a liquid waste that is formed in a bees malpighian tubules \u2013 the insect equivalent of kidneys. Here, it\u2019s mixed with other waste products before it is expelled out of the body. The amount of uric acid that\u2019s released is very small. This makes an image capturing this moment very rare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this, Juanita encouraged Liz to upload the observation to iNaturalist Australia. This enabled the sighting to become a useful piece of biodiversity data accessible via the ALA. The <a href=\"https:\/\/inaturalist.ala.org.au\/observations\/65599556\">observation<\/a>, known as an occurrence record, contains useful data such as location, date, time as well as information about the species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different apps that feed data into the ALA.

Images stored by the ALA have even been used to build apps that can <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1109\/ICIP.2019.8803746\">automatically identify Australian insects<\/a> in the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As our data holdings continue to grow, researchers continue finding new ways to draw on ALA in their research, bettering the understanding of Australia\u2019s unique biodiversity. Now, you can search and browse some of this research through our new webpage, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/ala-cited-publications\/\">ALA-cited publications<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a researcher and use the ALA to access data or analytical tools, read <a href=\"https:\/\/support.ala.org.au\/support\/solutions\/articles\/6000195866-how-to-cite-the-ala\">How to cite the ALA<\/a> for more detail on best practices for citing and acknowledging the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ten years of the ALA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years ago, Australian national collections, science organisations, and government agencies saw the opportunity for a national online and open data repository for biodiversity data. The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) was established with funding from the Australian Government\u2019s National Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) to fulfill this role and aggregate Australia\u2019s biodiversity data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe ALA has changed the way biodiversity research and environmental decision making occurs in Australia,\u201d said ALA Director Dr Andre Zerger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe now have over 90 million occurrence records and function as the most comprehensive dataset on Australian biodiversity. The ALA has over 78,000 registered users and access to 700 datasets from data partners across research, government and citizen science.\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Built on partnerships<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Central to the success of the ALA are the contributions from our data partners. They are the backbone of the ALA, providing authoritative data for species names and classification, geospatial reference data, environmental layers, and species occurrence data. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe work of the organisations and institutions that provide data, and manage, curate and update that data, underpins our success and we look forward to continuing and growing these partnerships over another ten years,\u201d said Andre.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The diverse datasets all contribute to the rich tapestries of data that are accessible via the ALA, and enable the ALA to perform like a window into the complex world of biodiversity science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>National and global reach<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA not only delivers Australia\u2019s biodiversity data at a national level, it also contributes to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world&#8217;s governments to provide open access to data about all types of life on Earth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThrough the GBIF living atlases community, the infrastructure our team first developed 10 years ago is now being used by 27 countries around the world to manage their biodiversity data,\u201d said Andre.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA is the Australian node of GBIF and has significantly contributed to this global network for open biodiversity data access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More information<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/ala-cited-publications\/\">ALA-cited publications<\/a> to search and browse publications that reference the ALA.<\/li><li>Read <a href=\"https:\/\/support.ala.org.au\/support\/solutions\/articles\/6000195866-how-to-cite-the-ala\">How to cite the ALA<\/a> for more detail on best practices for citing and acknowledging the ALA.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 2020, we\u2019re celebrating 10 years of the Atlas of Living Australia and today we launch a new feature to showcase ALA research impact.
