It\u2019s critically endangered with a population estimated at 300-500 individuals. This estimate was before the 2019-20 bushfires.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 90 per cent of the dunnarts\u2019 habitat was burnt in the bushfires. Therefore there\u2019s been a significant decline in the population. This means it\u2019s more important than ever to track and protect these animals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, we launched the virtual expeditions and Kangaroo Island Dunnart Survey project as part of our Citizen Science Bushfire Project. And with great success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteers from across Australia joined the expeditions. They reviewed a series of images and a list of possible animals to look out for. Keen-eyes worked out what species were in the images. And once submitted, the team sent the next set of images. Addictive, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within three weeks of launching, the volunteers identified and classified 15,000 images for the dunnart survey. The team were overwhelmed with eager people asking when there would be more images to transcribe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44093\" width=\"911\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 911px) 100vw, 911px\" \/><figcaption>Volunteers identified the species found in images like this one taken by motion sensing cameras.

Corals are the most plant-like of all animals, deriving much of their energy from photosynthesis via microscopic algae that live symbiotically within their tissues. But perhaps most importantly, eucalypts and reef corals are the key foundation species in their respective ecosystems, providing much of the framework that hundreds of thousands of other species rely upon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLosing these key foundation species would be catastrophic for many of our most diverse ecosystems,\u201d Booth said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCoral is the more vulnerable of the two groups when it comes to climate change but both collections of species have been and will be significantly affected.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-impact-of-climate-change\">The impact of climate change<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bleached-coral-at-Rib-Reef-April-2020-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir.-1024x766.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44073\" width=\"399\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bleached-coral-at-Rib-Reef-April-2020-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir.-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bleached-coral-at-Rib-Reef-April-2020-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir.-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bleached-coral-at-Rib-Reef-April-2020-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir.-768x575.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bleached-coral-at-Rib-Reef-April-2020-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir.-1536x1149.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bleached-coral-at-Rib-Reef-April-2020-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir.-2048x1532.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bleached-coral-at-Rib-Reef-April-2020-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir.-1920x1437.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Bleached-coral-at-Rib-Reef-April-2020-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir.-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" \/><figcaption>Bleached coral at Rib Reef, April 2020, central GBR off Townsville.

More recently, eucalypt researchers from various agencies have predicted likely future changes in species distribution under various climate change scenarios. These results are critical for managing ecosystems, for example by identifying particularly vulnerable species and tailoring management responses to prevent species declines. Researchers have spent many years working collaboratively with other colleagues and institutions developing the large datasets of species distributions and environmental conditions that are required for SDM analyses. In contrast, SDM analyses have only rarely been used in coral research but could provide important information for managing the future of reefs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am hoping the work we have done with eucalypts can help coral researchers benefit from these methods and avoid some of the traps,\u201d Booth said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four key areas of research Booth and Muir considered in the journal article were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(1) modelling current distributions,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(2) assessing impacts of climate change on future distributions,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(3) using human-assisted migration to improve survival and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(4) applying genetic enhancement to improve species\u2019 survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With many years of examining the climatic tolerances of eucalypts, it is not surprising that experience from eucalypt studies may have more to offer climate change studies of corals than vice versa.
