It is also essential for mitigation, planning and recovery efforts. People working in this area require datasets that include the full spatial and temporal information about target species. These datasets often reside in jurisdictional data repositories and are hard to access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Current challenges in accessing data on threatened species<br><\/strong>There are many challenges facing people researching and managing sensitive and threatened species in Australia.

The data come from a range of sources that are public (primarily ALA) and restricted (jurisdictions, researchers, private). Access to restricted data can be sought, but the process is time consuming, and it\u2019s not always clear who to approach, or how. A key focus for the project will be developing and implementing a National Framework to address issues such as licensing, access and authority, governance and programmatic standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fuzzy wuzzy data<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obscuring or fuzzying threatened species data is a necessary practice to ensure vulnerable species are protected from poachers or habitat destruction and prevent unscrupulous researchers from accessing data. However, there is no nationally standardised way for obscuring precise location data. Each institution is reliant on internal or third party (state conservation agency or the Atlas of Living Australia) to fuzz data. Accidental data releases are an ever-present threat that manifests regularly. A national approach to fuzzing and un-fuzzing data will provide a vital risk-mitigation mechanism for protecting threatened species and research data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Sensitive Species Data Pathways project partners<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We look forward to working with the following partners on this important project:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Australian Research Data Commons<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (Commonwealth)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (NSW)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (WA)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Environment and Water (SA)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (TAS)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (VIC)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Environment and Science (QLD)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NT)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>The Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate (ACT)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Western Australian Biodiversity Research Institute (WABSI)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Atlas of Living Australia, CSIRO<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;EcoCommons Australia<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Pawsey Super Computing Centre<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Council of Heads of Australian Faunal Collections<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on this project, please contact <a href=\"mailto:support@ala.org.au\">support@ala.org.au<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sensitive Species Data Pathways project&nbsp; DOI <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.47486\/PS027\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.47486\/PS027<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ardc.edu.au\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB-1024x334.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44562\" width=\"254\" height=\"83\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB-1024x334.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB-300x98.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB-768x250.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB.png 1181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In January 2021, we started a new collaborative project that aims to address some of the major challenges for people working with sensitive and threatened species data.

They used it to reconstruct near-complete mitochondrial genomes, a first using eggshells of non-ratite birds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, a team from ANWC and the Australian National University announced DNA can be extracted from very small eggshells held in museum collections without causing damage to the integrity or appearance of the specimen. The team demonstrated how their new sampling technique can be used to confirm the identity of unknown specimens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the world there are nearly 5 million eggshell specimens held in natural history collections. Many were collected by hobbyists in the past, before egg collecting was made illegal in most countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-1024x1007.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44538\" width=\"309\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-1024x1007.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-300x295.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO-768x755.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Eggs-ANWC-CSIRO.png 1144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" \/><figcaption>Eggs specimens shown before (left) and after (right) drilling to extract DNA for this study.

But bird eggshells often lack metadata because the eggs of different species can look very similar,\u201d said lead author Alicia Grealy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn this study we examined 45 different eggshell specimens from ANWC that lacked metadata. We compared different sampling methods, such as swabbing the surface of eggshells, but ultimately optimised a drilling technique to retrieve eggshell powder. This provided us with sufficient DNA to identify the species while keeping the specimen intact,\u201d Alicia said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team cross-checked the species IDs they generated by using the Atlas of Living Australia to compare the morphology of each egg specimen with published reference photographs of that taxon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe then put the method to the test on a clutch of eggs in ANWC that purportedly were of the extinct Paradise Parrot,\u201d Alicia said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:5cc6c8d2-50dc-4c9f-9b12-5423b6da6f18\">Paradise Parrot (<em>Psephotellus pulcherrimus<\/em><\/a>) was listed as extinct in 1927.

From there, I\u2019ve been on this journey and found out more about bees than I ever expected!\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her quest for more information, Liz contacted Entomologist Juanita Rodriguez at CSIRO\u2019s Australian National Insect Collection, who confirmed the sighting was pretty rare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a rare event Liz captured and she took an excellent photo. &nbsp;Bees release liquid waste called uric acid, but they release it in such small amounts so it\u2019s unusual to witness it \u2013 and images like this are rare,\u201d said Juanita.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uric acid is a liquid waste that is formed in a bees malpighian tubules \u2013 the insect equivalent of kidneys. Here, it\u2019s mixed with other waste products before it is expelled out of the body. The amount of uric acid that\u2019s released is very small. This makes an image capturing this moment very rare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this, Juanita encouraged Liz to upload the observation to iNaturalist Australia. This enabled the sighting to become a useful piece of biodiversity data accessible via the ALA. The <a href=\"https:\/\/inaturalist.ala.org.au\/observations\/65599556\">observation<\/a>, known as an occurrence record, contains useful data such as location, date, time as well as information about the species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different apps that feed data into the ALA. For a full list of apps and citizen science projects search the <a href=\"https:\/\/biocollect.ala.org.au\/acsa#isCitizenScience%3Dtrue%26isWorldWide%3Dfalse%26max%3D20%26sort%3DdateCreatedSort\">Australian Citizen Science Project Finder<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI knew this was a rare photograph, and I thought there must be someone somewhere who can use this photo for bee education or similar. But I was at loss on where I could post it to share it properly,\u201d said Liz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was really grateful to learn about iNaturalist and am really happy to share it with others who also may find it interesting. I love my little bee photo \u2013 I\u2019ve called him Bubble Bum due to the bubble on his bum!\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To upload your own observations, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/inaturalist.ala.org.au\/\">https:\/\/inaturalist.ala.org.au<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amateur naturalist Liz Barratt caught this candid photo of a European Honey Bee on her property in Moffatdale, Queensland.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44479,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11,14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44478"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44478"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44478\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44487,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44478\/revisions\/44487"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44479"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44478"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44478"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44478"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
