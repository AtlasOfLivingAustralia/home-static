Early and ongoing investment from the Australian Government National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy was timely and has had a lasting impact on how biodiversity data are managed and accessed on a global scale.\u201d says ALA Director Dr Andre Zerger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cWe thought it was time to document this history and achievement and I believe this paper will become a critical reference for the international biodiversity data community.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking back \u2013 our origin story<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s set the scene \u2013 it\u2019s the late 1990s. You are a taxonomist&nbsp;trying to find specimen data for a research project. To find this information you must personally contact managers of collections, undertake formal loans of specimens from many museums, or travel across the country and internationally to get access to where specimens of interest have been recorded. After months of letters, emails and phone calls, you\u2019re finally able to analyse the data and start your research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a process that was kept on repeat for decades. Finding and accessing biodiversity data was a major challenge, it wasn\u2019t accessible or shared between organisations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the mid-2000s, the research community saw opportunity in emerging digital technologies and significant collaborative initiatives were underway to start to share data. Cue the review of national research infrastructure. The findings of this review led to the Australian Government accepting the &nbsp;proposal of the natural history collections community &nbsp;\u2013 to build on the collaboration already well advanced to create a single online platform that would harmonises all existing databases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2006, 25 representatives from across biological collections met at the Australian Museum in Sydney. Here, the group identified the significant benefits of an aggregated database and the Atlas of Living Australia was formed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here we are now \u2013 Australia\u2019s national biodiversity database<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flash forward to the present day, we now successfully aggregate and harmonise biodiversity data from not only museum and herbarium collections, but &nbsp;government departments, research institutions, Indigenous knowledge holders, community groups, universities, and individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, we celebrated our 10 years of making biodiversity information accessible to all. Our celebrations were particularly focussed on thanking the founding partners and biodiversity data providers that helped us reach where we are today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 10 years since our launch, we have achieved many milestones and enabled impact across the globe. There are now more than 90 million occurrence records of 110,000 species, 5000 species lists, 2000 biodiversity-related projects, 500 environmental layers. We have also enabled a number of biodiversity data portals by making the underlying ALA code openly available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also taken a leadership role globally through the Living Atlases program. There are instances of ALA software delivering national biodiversity capabilities in 24 countries around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"903\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/10-stats-for-10-years_image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44393\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/10-stats-for-10-years_image.png 903w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/10-stats-for-10-years_image-300x213.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/10-stats-for-10-years_image-768x544.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does the future hold?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following our Future Directions National Consultation process in 2019, we began to shift our focus to the new challenges ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The consultation process highlighted how far the ALA has come and the impact we have had on the way Australian biodiversity data are utilised. However, the consultation also highlighted some areas of improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To reach our full potential and continue delivering innovative data solutions, the ALA will have a future focus on projects that aim to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>increase data quality within the ALA<\/li><li>deliver a diverse range of data to support biodiversity reporting<\/li><li>harmonise industry data gathered through surveys with existing data available through museums, herbaria, and state data programmes<\/li><li>take a leadership role in facilitating cooperation and collaboration between institutions<\/li><li>integrate additional data streams, such as images, genomics, sounds recordings and environmental assessment data to paint a more extensive picture of Australian biodiversity.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have already embarked on several projects to transform the way people access biodiversity data through the ALA.

It also poses a particular challenge for the researchers like Ross and his team. The inconsistency in bird call means it is difficult to research these birds and protect them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Regent Honeyeater was commonly found throughout Australia\u2019s south-east, but due to land clearing since the 1960s, it is now on the verge of extinction (critically endangered in NSW and QLD, endangered in ACT and SA). The most recent data suggests there are probably less than 350 individuals remaining. This makes it more important than ever for researchers to investigate ways to protect them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"can-songs-provide-insights-into-species-decline\">Can songs provide insights into species decline?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the rapid decline in species numbers, Ross and his team are looking into many different factors affecting Regent Honeyeater populations. These include habitat requirements, the range of Eucalyptus trees they like to feed on, and genetic analysis. He has also been listening to the honeyeater\u2019s bird songs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to investigate the impact of population decline on the songs they sing, the complexity of the song and also their individual fitness,\u201d said Ross.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe were particularly looking at the male birds because the song is a crucial tool to attract a mate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"finding-the-data-live-recordings-and-the-back-catalogue\"><strong>Finding the data: live recordings and the back catalogue<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ross pulled together lots of Regent Honeyeater data from surveys and BirdLife Australia sightings. This data was used to assess distribution and density of the remaining wild populations. For the sound recordings of the honeyeaters\u2019 contemporary songs, the research team recorded birds in the wild and in captivity. They then used the ALA to find historical song recordings of wild males from 1986 to 2011.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe ALA provides access to over 5,200 sound files of bird songs. This was incredibly useful for us as we could make comparisons and work out how regent honeyeater songs have changed over time,\u201d said Ross.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then it was time for some easy listening \u2013 was their old stuff better than their new stuff?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"how-the-songs-of-the-regent-honeyeater-have-changed\"><strong>How the songs of the Regent Honeyeater have changed<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Regent-Honeyeater-uploaded-to-iNaturalist-by-deborod-in-Canberra--1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44648\" width=\"425\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Regent-Honeyeater-uploaded-to-iNaturalist-by-deborod-in-Canberra--1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Regent-Honeyeater-uploaded-to-iNaturalist-by-deborod-in-Canberra--300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Regent-Honeyeater-uploaded-to-iNaturalist-by-deborod-in-Canberra--768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Regent-Honeyeater-uploaded-to-iNaturalist-by-deborod-in-Canberra--1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Regent-Honeyeater-uploaded-to-iNaturalist-by-deborod-in-Canberra-.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" \/><figcaption>Regent Honeyeater observation uploaded to iNaturalist by deborod in Canberra.

They found the two main groups of wild birds had their own distinct songs: The Blue Mountains song and the Northern Tablelands song.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also found that some birds within each group sang different songs. Some sang a shortened version of their group\u2019s song, but others copied the songs of much more abundant birds, such as the Little Wattlebird, Noisy Friarbird, Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater, Pied Currawong, and Eastern Rosella.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe found that Regent Honeyeaters were copying other birds and singing atypical songs, if their population density was low in that area. Males that sang other species&#8217; songs had significantly fewer conspecifics (birds of the same species) living close by, than males that sang species-specific songs,\u201d said Ross.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe also found that birds that sang different songs were less likely to be paired with a female in that breeding season.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"impact-of-this-research\"><strong>Impact of this research<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In this research paper, Ross\u2019 team have come closer to understanding how animal cultures are maintained, the conditions under which they are lost, and the impact this has on both species\u2019 evolution and conservation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe found rare evidence showing that a severe decline in population size and density is associated with the loss of vocal culture in a wild animal population. This is similar to the loss of human languages globally,\u201d said Ross.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAlso, for the first time, we\u2019ve shown that birds in very small groups in the wild suffer from significant changes that affect their fitness to reproduce. And these changes may speed up the decline in numbers.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"changing-the-way-we-monitor-endangered-bird-populations\"><strong>Changing the way we monitor endangered bird populations<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>By researching the endangered Regent Honeyeater and their changing songbook, Ross and his team have found that the birds are changing their songs to learn songs of more abundant species. This may be a precursor to extinction in already declining populations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis approach \u2013 where we monitor how birds are changing their songs \u2013 may provide a new way for assessing the trajectory of population decline, especially for species whose populations are very difficult to monitor in traditional ways,\u201d said Ross.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"for-more-information\"><strong>For more information:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Read the full research paper (open access): <a href=\"https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/doi\/10.1098\/rspb.2021.0225\">Loss of vocal culture and fitness costs in a critically endangered songbird<\/a><\/li><li>Use the ALA to listen to other bird calls.

The data come from a range of sources that are public (primarily ALA) and restricted (jurisdictions, researchers, private). Access to restricted data can be sought, but the process is time consuming, and it\u2019s not always clear who to approach, or how. A key focus for the project will be developing and implementing a National Framework to address issues such as licensing, access and authority, governance and programmatic standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fuzzy wuzzy data<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obscuring or fuzzying threatened species data is a necessary practice to ensure vulnerable species are protected from poachers or habitat destruction and prevent unscrupulous researchers from accessing data. However, there is no nationally standardised way for obscuring precise location data. Each institution is reliant on internal or third party (state conservation agency or the Atlas of Living Australia) to fuzz data. Accidental data releases are an ever-present threat that manifests regularly. A national approach to fuzzing and un-fuzzing data will provide a vital risk-mitigation mechanism for protecting threatened species and research data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Sensitive Species Data Pathways project partners<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We look forward to working with the following partners on this important project:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Australian Research Data Commons<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (Commonwealth)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (NSW)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (WA)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Environment and Water (SA)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (TAS)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (VIC)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Environment and Science (QLD)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NT)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>The Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate (ACT)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Western Australian Biodiversity Research Institute (WABSI)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Atlas of Living Australia, CSIRO<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;EcoCommons Australia<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Pawsey Super Computing Centre<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>&nbsp;Council of Heads of Australian Faunal Collections<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on this project, please contact <a href=\"mailto:support@ala.org.au\">support@ala.org.au<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sensitive Species Data Pathways project&nbsp; DOI <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.47486\/PS027\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.47486\/PS027<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ardc.edu.au\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB-1024x334.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44562\" width=\"254\" height=\"83\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB-1024x334.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB-300x98.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB-768x250.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/02\/ARDC_logo_RGB.png 1181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In January 2021, we started a new collaborative project that aims to address some of the major challenges for people working with sensitive and threatened species data.
