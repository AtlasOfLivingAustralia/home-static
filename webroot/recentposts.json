This species is reliant on mudflats and mangrove swamps for feeding and breeding. Unfortunately, this species is listed as \u2018endangered\u2019 due to loss of habitat, causing population decline across their ranges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"608\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Speckled-Orbweaver-Araneus-circulissparsus-Jackie-Lien-CC-BY-NC-1024x608.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47477\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Speckled-Orbweaver-Araneus-circulissparsus-Jackie-Lien-CC-BY-NC-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Speckled-Orbweaver-Araneus-circulissparsus-Jackie-Lien-CC-BY-NC-300x178.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Speckled-Orbweaver-Araneus-circulissparsus-Jackie-Lien-CC-BY-NC-768x456.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Speckled-Orbweaver-Araneus-circulissparsus-Jackie-Lien-CC-BY-NC-1536x911.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Speckled-Orbweaver-Araneus-circulissparsus-Jackie-Lien-CC-BY-NC-1920x1139.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Speckled-Orbweaver-Araneus-circulissparsus-Jackie-Lien-CC-BY-NC.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Speckled Orbweaver (<em>Araneus circulissparsus)<\/em> Jackie Lien CC BY NC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/taxa\/487451\">Speckled Orbweaver<\/a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/taxa\/487451\"><em>Araneus circulissparsus<\/em><\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hairy, spotty and slime green!

Orbweavers occupy crevices and leaves during the day, and if they feel significantly threatened, they will drop to the ground and \u2018play dead.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Speckled Orbweaver prefers to occupy green foliage, to blend in with the surroundings. As with many spider species, females are larger than males at approximately 6mm in length, with males 3mm in length.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ghost Fungus (<em>Omphalotus nidiformis<\/em>) Monica Knipler CC BY NC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u><a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/https:\/id.biodiversity.org.au\/node\/fungi\/60094367\">Ghost Fungus <em>(Omphalotus nidiformis<\/em><\/a><\/u><\/strong>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like something out of a fairy-tale, Ghost Fungi glow through their gills with a green-tinged light. They emit \u2018cold light\u2019 where less than 20% of light emitted is capable of radiating heat. Ghost Fungi, and other bioluminescent creatures, fluoresce using a compound called \u2018luciferin\u2019. They grow on dead or decaying wood and are commonly found across Australia in temperate areas. The exact reason this species uses bioluminescence is not known, however a theory is that by glowing the fungi attracts insects which disperse its spores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghost Fungi are poisonous if consumed, however are often mistaken for Oyster Mushrooms due to their similar fan-like appearance and milky-white colouration in the daytime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn how to upload species records and contribute to the Atlas of Living Australia, check our this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/home\/record-a-sighting\/\">link<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Does it croak or growl, have fangs or howl?
