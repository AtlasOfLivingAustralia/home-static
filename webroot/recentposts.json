This is one of ALA\u2019s flagship programs that was designed three years ago to provide a mechanism to support the digitisation and provision of important biodiversity that may otherwise not be provided to the ALA. In the first two years the program has supported 12 remarkable teams to digitally enable their data and make it available to the ALA as open data, and through that effort internationally to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/abdmp\/\">12 current projects <\/a>span a range of\u00a0incredible institutions, species, and provide important geographic coverage. This year we are excited to have secured additional support from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/en\/about\/challenges-missions\/biosecurity\">CSIRO\u2019s Catalysing Australia\u2019s Biosecurity initiative<\/a>. This will provide additional focus on species of biosecurity concern which we know will generate additional excitement around the program, and deliver data to the ALA that assists Australia\u2019s biosecurity sector to better assess risk, and mitigations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ALA\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/09\/ALA-Strategy-2020-2025.pdf\">Strategy 2020-2025<\/a> has an action to \u2018establish data priorities to ensure Australia has a nationally comprehensive, representative and adequate biodiversity data infrastructure\u2019. In addition to supporting those parts of the biodiversity data sector that may be resource constrained, the Data Mobilisation Program has become an important mechanism for independently identifying data priorities, whether geographic or taxonomic and starting to fill these gaps in our national biodiversity data system. The existing 12 projects, and approximately nine projects we expect to fund in 2024 will play a fundamental role in ensuring the Australian biodiversity research, management and policy landscape has access to the best available data. The launch of Round 3 also provides a timely reminder that we are keen to grow this important national program through <a href=\"https:\/\/ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ALA-Australian-Biodiversity-Data-Mobilisation-Program-Prospectus-December-2022.pdf\">partnerships<\/a> with government, industry and the research sector so please do reach out if you\u2019d like to play a supporting role in future years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy our March Newsletter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the March 2024 edition of our Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) newsletter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49342"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=49342"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49342\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49347,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49342\/revisions\/49347"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=49342"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=49342"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=49342"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49299,"date":"2024-03-19T08:16:43","date_gmt":"2024-03-18T21:16:43","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=49299"},"modified":"2024-03-19T13:04:56","modified_gmt":"2024-03-19T02:04:56","slug":"taxonomist-appreciation-day-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/taxonomist-appreciation-day-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Taxonomist Appreciation Day"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19<sup>th<\/sup> March is the perfect day to celebrate and share some facts about tax(onomy) in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)!  We sat down with Cam Slatyer who is a Project Manager in the ALA to chat about his extensive experience and incredible stories working across taxonomy throughout his career. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: How is taxonomy evolving in the ALA and what\u2019s your role in this project?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: The ALA has a fascinating challenge with taxonomy. We bring together data from Australia and the world, historic and new. Taxonomy is a living, evolving science where names are proposed by scientists as theories, some are accepted, and some aren\u2019t. Names change over time.&nbsp; Take the Platypus, which has the scientific name (<em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus). <\/em>When it was first described by science, it was called <em>(Platypus anatinus<\/em>), but someone discovered that the name was already being used for a group of beetles (and still is). You can\u2019t have that in taxonomy. The International Codes of Nomenclature (which definitely aren\u2019t like the Pirate Code in <em>Pirates of the Caribbean<\/em>) try to stop that sort of thing. It\u2019s like not having two people in the same friendship with the same name: they end up getting called Cam 1 and Cam 2 or Blue because one has red hair. This has meant that the poor old Platypus has a scientific name that means duck-like bird-snout&#8230; which is a pretty good description really.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the ALA, we need to cope with all names,  for everything from viruses to mountain ash to make sure that data end up under the best available name. That has been a challenge ever since the ALA first started, but now with more than 135 million records, it is vast. My job with my colleagues, is to improve it. We rely heavily on the Australian Government\u2019s Australian Biological Resources Study, who have spent the last few years putting together a National Species List, as well as the Australian Plant Census, run by all the herbaria in Australia, to get our names. We also take names from the New Zealand Organism Register and the International Catalogue of Life to make names match. So our job for the next year or so, is removing things like duplicates, adding missing names and improving name matching. One of our biggest challenges is the differences between Australia and New Zealand. It isn\u2019t just the All Blacks we need to keep an eye on! There are important scientific reasons why Australia and New Zealand have different names for the same things, but we are trying to make sure the New Zealand species have New Zealand names and the Australian species have Australian names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC.jpg 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Platypus (<em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus) <\/em>Photo Credit adamrichardt CC BY NC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Tell us about your experience working in taxonomy!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: I\u2019m not a taxonomist, but I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work alongside taxonomists for many years. I\u2019ve seen an amazing array of new species and been privileged enough to have three species named after me. My favourite experience was working on heritage listing mound springs, which are incredibly important and unique freshwater springs in Queensland and South Australia, having species that are often found nowhere else on Earth. I was accompanying a freshwater snail taxonomist, looking for new species and checking on existing ones. We\u2019d been through dozens of springs and hadn\u2019t found any new species, which was enormously frustrating. I was looking for frogs while my colleagues were sieving for snails (mound spring snails are tiny). I found these little black dots on some leaves and showed them to the scientist. Turns out it was the only new species of the trip, were described and then immediately identified as endangered. Not bad for a frog person!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What are some current challenges in the field of taxonomy?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Sadly, the biggest challenge is the same as when I first started working with taxonomists in the late 1990s. We are running out of taxonomists, which is frightening given they are essential for identifying threats such as the recent Varroa mite incursion, or understanding the status of threatened species. Over a third of the taxonomists in Australia are voluntary \u2013 retirees or people doing taxonomy in their spare time. Government funding for taxonomy hasn\u2019t been increased since 1974 and museums and herbaria are the mainstay of our capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Do you have a favourite species?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Australia has around 154,000 named species. I think I have new favourites as I learn about them. But most of my regular favourites are frogs, including the stuttering frog (<em>Mixophyes balbus<\/em>) or bats like the golden-tipped bat (<em>Phoniscus papuensis<\/em>)!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49301\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-1920x1280.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stuttering Frog (<em>Mixophyes balbus)<\/em> Photo Credit Daniel CC BY NC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-1920x1440.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-640x480.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Golden-tipped Bat (<em>Phoniscus papuensis<\/em>) Photo Credit donnamarietomkinson CC BY NC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>19th March is the perfect day to celebrate and share some facts about tax(onomy) in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)!

Species taxonomy is continuously evolving based on new scientific discoveries (new species being described), as well as techniques such as genetic sequencing, bioinformatics and advanced imaging which can change the way researchers understand existing species leading to re-classification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To accurately reflect current taxonomy of species listed within the ALA, we are continuously working to improve our \u2018taxonomic backbone\u2019 i.e. source material for which species in the ALA are structured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How species are structured in the ALA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/support.ala.org.au\/support\/solutions\/articles\/6000261677-taxonomy-in-the-ala\">taxonomic backbone<\/a>&nbsp;is principally sourced from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/biodiversity.org.au\/nsl\/\">National Species List (NSL)<\/a>, but we also draw names from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nzor.org.nz\/\">New Zealand Organism Register (NZOR)<\/a>&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.catalogueoflife.org\/\">Catalogue of Life (CoL)<\/a>. We have recently undergone significant changes to align our taxonomic backbone to better fit current scientific names recognised in Australia. This reduces duplication of species listings in the ALA and improves accuracy and navigation when users are searching for new species or threatened species records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the numbers?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2023, the ALA had 154,506 species of animals (with 2,400 unranked animal species listings) and 48,972 species of plants (with 5,555 unranked plant species listings), giving a total of ~ 211,000 plant and animal species recorded in the ALA. Unranked species are species that either cannot be placed in the taxonomy or have been added to enable data matching to an existing species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through our recent work to improve ALA\u2019s taxonomic backbone removing duplication and aligning to current taxonomy, we have reduced these listings to 124,999 animal species (with 11 unranked) and 41,740 plant species (with 37 unranked). Whilst improving ALA\u2019s taxonomy is an evolving process, this represents a major removal of duplication and error fixing in the ALA\u2019s species listings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do these changes look like in the ALA?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though much of the work to refresh the ALA taxonomic backbone is in the back-end, here are some visible changes that you may notice across the ALA:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improving synonym matching<\/strong> \u2013 With thousands of unique species in Australia, and more being described and named every year, many species are known by more than one name. While the ALA uses the NSL to source synonyms for species (different names referring to the same speices), there are still differences in names, particularly those used internationally. For example, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/https:\/\/biodiversity.org.au\/afd\/taxa\/0d3239e3-927e-43c1-9d65-4a5e75fe33d3\">Green Tree Frog (<em>Litoria caerulea<\/em>)<\/a>\u00a0is known internationally as (<em>Ranoidea careulea)<\/em>\u00a0in data sets such as iNaturalist. The changed taxonomy will now mean that many of these synonyms will match to the scientific name that species are most commonly known by in Australia.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Placing names in the taxonomic hierarchy<\/strong> \u2013 The ALA places species within a taxonomy tree, like a family tree. The taxonomic backbone refresh means that we have resolved many previous errors and repeat entries for invertebrates, vertebrates and vascular plants.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Correcting species entries<\/strong> \u2013 We have taken steps to remove duplications and unresolved synonyms in the ALA by reducing the number of sources for our taxonomic backbone.

Home to more than 132 million species occurrence records of native and introduced species, the ALA is often the first platform where invasive species incursions are publicly recorded. Invasive species \u2013 like pests, weeds, and diseases \u2013 are a major driver of biodiversity loss and pose significant threats to both the economy and our community. To ensure management authorities are notified of new incursions, the ALA has partnered with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agriculture.gov.au\/\">Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/\">CSIRO<\/a> through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/en\/about\/challenges-missions\/biosecurity\">Catalysing Australia\u2019s Biosecurity<\/a> initiative to develop the Biosecurity Alerts Service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA\u2019s Biosecurity Alerts Service provides weekly email notifications of occurrences of invasive species to management authorities. These occurrences are aggregated from more than 850 data suppliers, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/\">iNaturalist<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feralscan.org.au\/\">FeralScan<\/a>. The Biosecurity Alerts Service reports the species name, observation location, images, data provider and provides direct links to the ALA occurrence record. Up until the end of 2023, 1,441 occurrences of invasive species had triggered a biosecurity alert, which included reports of highly invasive species, such as red imported fire ants (<em>Solenopsis invicta)<\/em>, Asian sho<a>re crabs (<em>Hemigrapsus sanguineus<\/em>), m<\/a>yrtle rust and <em>Opuntia <\/em>cacti.

While we have only been using it for a short period we have already recorded several significant detections. I\u2019ve been promoting the system at every opportunity,\u201d said Steve Csurhes, Biosecurity Queensland, Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the ALA has developed new <a>spatial filtering features <\/a>within the Biosecurity Alerts Service. This has allowed users to limit alerts to within state\/territory or local government boundaries (including marine boundaries) or provide a custom spatial boundary (shapefile) for alerts within a user-defined area. This has improved the utility of biosecurity alerts, allowing them to be used more readily for reporting within National Parks boundaries or outside of biosecurity containment zones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA is currently delivering Phase 1 of the Biosecurity Alert Service, which includes roll out of the Service to Commonwealth, State and Territory biosecurity managers. Phase 2 will begin in mid-2024 with operational enhancements allowing the service to scale nationally better, and the inclusion of interested local government areas, natural resource managers, non-government organisations and others within the biosecurity sector.

These reports help to inform early detection and long-term management of biosecurity threats. The ALA works with more than 850 data partners to aggregate native and invasive records, making this information easily accessible through open data.

Senior Principal Forest Pathologist Dr Geoff Pegg at Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries has said that since myrtle rust was first detected in Australia, it has been a significant contributor to the decline in some of our most iconic native trees like the native guava and scrub turpentine, which were previously common across Queensland and New South Wales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cPeople often think that biosecurity starts and stops at the border, but what happens post-border is just as important. Managing these threats in native ecosystems is challenging. I\u2019ve seen first-hand the devastating effects that invasive diseases like myrtle rust have on our biodiversity. Areas of outstanding natural beauty and ecological significance, such as the Daintree and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation<\/em>&nbsp;(<em>UNESCO) World Heritage Gondwana Rainforests, are now threatened due to the rapid spread of myrtle rust.\u201d<\/em><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to spot myrtle rust infection<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Myrtle rust affects seedlings, saplings and old established trees.&nbsp;The most distinct symptom of myrtle rust is bright yellow spores on new leaves, stems, flowers, or fruit. Leaves can become deformed and in severe cases, may die and appear scorched. Repeated infections can reduce plant vigour, cause significant defoliation, killing more susceptible trees and preventing flowering and fruiting on others, thereby interfering with reproduction and reducing the food resources for many native animals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"786\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-786x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49196\" style=\"width:446px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-786x1024.jpg 786w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-230x300.jpg 230w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-768x1000.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-1179x1536.jpg 1179w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5.jpg 1448w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Myrtle rust on <a>Midgen berr<\/a>ies (<em>Austromyrtus dulcis)<\/em> &#8211; Photo Credit Geoff Pegg, Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"628\" height=\"942\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Geoff-Pgg.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49197\" style=\"width:446px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Geoff-Pgg.jpg 628w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Geoff-Pgg-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Repeated myrtle rust infection has almost killed this 100-year-old Sour cherry tree (<em>Syzygium corynanthum<\/em>) in the Tallebudgera Valley <a>&#8211; Photo Credit Geoff Pegg<\/a>, Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Help provide up-to-date myrtle rust data<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To combat the threat of myrtle rust, current data is required to inform researchers, policymakers, landholders and decision-makers about how myrtle rust spreads&nbsp;and impacts different plant communities.

When people report these myrtle rust sightings, we get a broader understanding of the extent of the disease which gives us a chance to fight back against the spread.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The myrtle rust data from citizen scientists are then aggregated in the ALA with data collected from other sources, such as professional scientists, industry and government agencies, to be open and accessible data points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to report myrtle rust sightings<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By collecting myrtle rust data, you\u2019re helping to paint a more detailed picture of Australia\u2019s invasive species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Install a citizen science app such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/inaturalist.ala.org.au\/pages\/getting+started\">iNaturalist<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/naturemapr.org\/content\/how-to\">NatureMapr<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ALA-Myrtle-Rust-Reporting-Guide.pdf\">ALA Myrtle Rust Reporting Guide<\/a><\/strong> to help you identify and capture the critical information to report possible myrtle rust sightings.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t touch!<\/strong>&nbsp;Follow&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dcceew.gov.au\/environment\/invasive-species\/diseases-fungi-and-parasites\/myrtle-rust\">best practices<\/a>&nbsp;to avoid accidentally spreading pathogens like myrtle rust!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check out citizen science projects like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/projects\/gum-tree-guardians\">iNaturalist project Gum Tree Guardians<\/a>&nbsp;to connect with experts and learn more about myrtle rust in Australia.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/biosecurity\/\">ALA Biosecurity Hub<\/a>&nbsp;or contact us&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/contact-us\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/projects\/gum-tree-guardians\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"717\" height=\"253\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Gum-tree-guardians.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49198\" style=\"width:278px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Gum-tree-guardians.png 717w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Gum-tree-guardians-300x106.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.anpc.asn.au\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ANPC_inline_col-1024x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49271\" style=\"width:283px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ANPC_inline_col-1024x300.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ANPC_inline_col-300x88.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ANPC_inline_col-768x225.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ANPC_inline_col.png 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tackling invasive species with data<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":49291,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49194"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=49194"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49194\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49286,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49194\/revisions\/49286"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/49291"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=49194"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=49194"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=49194"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
