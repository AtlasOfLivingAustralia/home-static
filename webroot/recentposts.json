Many researchers routinely use programming languages to request data, rather than manually navigating our website. For the biodiversity research community, the most commonly used programming language is called \u2018R\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>R is a useful programming language by itself; but it\u2019s most valuable feature is the ability to write and share bundles of software \u2013 called \u2018packages\u2019 \u2013 which users can install to achieve specific tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>galah<\/em> enables ALA users to locate and download occurrence records, taxonomic information, and associated media such as images or sounds.

First, it is an iconic Australian species that many people will be familiar with. Second, the word galah already contains the acronym \u2018ALA\u2019. Finally, a poll of users on social media chose <em>galah<\/em> over other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This package is the successor to the earlier <em>ALA4R<\/em>, which has been available for R users since 2014. <em>galah <\/em>provides an improved and simplified user experience to <em>ALA4R<\/em>, while still providing the same core functionality. <em>ALA4R <\/em>will be maintained but not actively developed while users transition to <em>galah<\/em>, and we encourage users to make the switch as soon as practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EcoCommons-training_galah.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44816\" width=\"400\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EcoCommons-training_galah.png 650w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EcoCommons-training_galah-300x240.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><figcaption>ALA developer Matilda Stevenson (bottom right) presents galah to an EcoCommons Software Carpentry workshop in June 2021.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"early-adoption-and-recent-updates\">Early adoption and recent updates<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we developed <em>galah<\/em>, early adopters have been testing the package extensively in classes and research projects around the country.

While we didn\u2019t find many pollinators, it showed the importance of seasonal sampling for true indication of pollinator diversity. Speeches, snacks and celebrations then followed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"840\" height=\"630\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2.jpg 840w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/BB-highway_2-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption><em>B&amp;B Highway participants looking for pollinators on a cold June day in Sydney<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone interested in finding out more about the B&amp;B Highway, and its educational resources, habitat constructions and the citizen science component <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ps.org.au\/bb-highway-school-info\">click here<\/a>.

This group includes species such as the ostrich, rhea, kiwi, cassowary and tinamou. The ratites are one of the most pre-historic groups of birds, in part because they are highly adaptable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emus have persisted in Australia through thousands of years; but anecdotal evidence suggests they are less common than they used to be. Increasing urbanisation and the removal of emus from farming lands means this species isn\u2019t as widespread as it once was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With populations condensing we begin to ask where will be the safe haven for emus in the future? It turns out answering this simple question is harder than you\u2019d think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every species has an area across which it can be found \u2013 a \u2018geographic distribution\u2019. Knowing exactly where this is helps us develop an understanding of the species, how it may adapt over time, and assist in decision making about conservation. For example, if a species only lives in a small area, it may be of larger concern compared to species that can be found all over the country, across a wide range of habitats and climates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia\u2019s climate has changed over many thousands of years, and the species that live here have moved with it. The country has been subject to long periods where it was wetter or drier, and where sea levels were lower or higher. This begged a series of questions &#8211; how have emus adapted to these changes, being one of the most pre-historic species? What effect have these changes had on where emus can live? How will this change with further human impact on the environment?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Emu-study-figure-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44779\" width=\"495\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Emu-study-figure-4.jpg 657w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Emu-study-figure-4-300x223.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" \/><figcaption>Predicted distribution change from ensemble models, across Australia and the Great Dividing Range region, past to present and present to future. The figures were generated in R (version 3.6.0,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.r-project.org\/\">https:\/\/www.r-project.org\/<\/a>).<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer these questions, we turned to a method called \u2018species distribution modelling\u2019 (SDM). SDMs take maps of where an animal has been seen and combines them with information about the environment at these locations, such as the climate (temperature and rainfall) and habitat (e.g. vegetation available and land uses). These combine to make a \u2018prediction map\u2019 of where a species can be found. The more sightings of a species there are, the more accurate these maps are likely to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, Emus are one of the most easily identified species and people love taking pictures of them! In fact, citizen scientists routinely record between 5,000 and 30,000 emu sightings every year across Australia. These sightings are collected and stored in a single place \u2013the Atlas of Living Australia (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\">https:\/\/www.ala.org.au<\/a>). Here, they can be freely viewed and downloaded by anyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these data, we built a model that shows the climate and habitat that emus prefer today; where suitable climate was 6,000 years ago; and where it will be in 50 years\u2019 time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found that in the past 6,000 years, emus have made vast shifts inland across central Australia. These shifts have been driven mostly by climate, with emus minimally influenced by environmental factors such as habitat type, distance from water, land use types or fire frequency. These changes have greatly expanded the emu\u2019s range and are predicted to remain stable over the next 50 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, however, emus have progressively been lost from the east coast. Now on the edge of their climatically suitable range, east coast emus are likely to be more susceptible to other threats, such as poor reproductive success due to predation by feral animals on the eggs and chicks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-1024x574.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44780\" width=\"444\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-1024x574.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-768x430.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image.jpg 1099w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" \/><figcaption>Camera trap image of emu feeding from an east coast population. Image credit: Julia Ryeland<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Emu disappearance across the east coast is unlikely to make the species vulnerable to the threat of extinction, because of the stability of their overall expansive range. However, the local extinction of emu populations across the east coast could have ecosystem wide implications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emus can travel up to 100km a year and move the seeds of native plants huge distances with them as they go. Without emus, many plant species will find it harder to disperse to new habitats or share genetic material between isolated plant communities. Combined with other threats such as habitat loss and predation by introduced species, our east coast plant communities could soon be in trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as poignant, though, is the importance of emus in Australian culture, both in European and Indigenous histories. The emu is a totem to many indigenous groups and is shown on the Australian coat of arms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the east coast where urbanisation is progressing rapidly, encountering a species such as the emu gives many Australian\u2019s an important connection to nature that can help inspire conservation efforts for our lesser known, declining fauna.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, read the full journal article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-020-79551-0\">Past and future potential range changes in one of the last large vertebrates of the Australian continent, the emu\u00a0<em>Dromaius novaehollandiae<\/em><\/a> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Julia Ryeland, Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44778,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44776"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44776"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44776\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44783,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44776\/revisions\/44783"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44778"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44776"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44776"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44776"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
