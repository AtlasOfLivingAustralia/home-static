As with many spider species, females are larger than males at approximately 6mm in length, with males 3mm in length.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ghost-Fungus-Omphalotus-nidiformis-credit-Monica-knipler-CC-BY-NC.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ghost Fungus (<em>Omphalotus nidiformis<\/em>) Monica Knipler CC BY NC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u><a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/https:\/id.biodiversity.org.au\/node\/fungi\/60094367\">Ghost Fungus <em>(Omphalotus nidiformis<\/em><\/a><\/u><\/strong>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like something out of a fairy-tale, Ghost Fungi glow through their gills with a green-tinged light.

Our journey began by hosting this year\u2019s annual meeting of the biodiversity data standards group <a href=\"https:\/\/tdwg2023.zohobackstage.com.au\/TDWG2023\">TDWG<\/a> in Hobart from October 9<sup>th<\/sup> to 13<sup>th<\/sup>. The event welcomed 166 participants from 26 countries (with 143 joining virtually) to present, learn and connect. We are grateful to those who continue the work of TDWG and biodiversity data standards. The TDWG-maintained Darwin Core standard has underpinned so many of the world&#8217;s biodiversity data systems, including the ALA, and ensures interoperable biodiversity data can move freely across platforms and borders. Events such as the TDWG annual meeting are fundamental in supporting the evolution of the standard and learning about the biodiversity science and applications it enables. <br><br>TDWG was a timely precursor to our next series of events hosted in Canberra and framed around the two-day Governing Board meeting of the <a href=\"https:\/\/gb30.gbif.org\/\">Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).<\/a> Australia last hosted the fourth Governing Board meeting (GB04) in 2002 at the National Academy of Sciences and then welcomed 18 countries to Canberra. 21 years later, we hosted 45 people from 30 countries at the National Portrait Gallery and CSIRO (with a further 28 participants joining online from 12 countries) to govern, support and grow the GBIF network. We were pleased to be joined by the Honourable Minister for the Environment and Water Tanya Plibersek at the gala dinner hosted at the National Museum of Australia. <a href=\"https:\/\/minister.dcceew.gov.au\/plibersek\/speeches\/speech-global-diversity-information-facility-gala-dinner\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/minister.dcceew.gov.au\/plibersek\/speeches\/speech-global-diversity-information-facility-gala-dinner\">The Minister&#8217;s address<\/a> affirmed the importance of data in supporting national and international biodiversity policy priorities and the ALA looks forward to working with our international and national partners to support these. <br><br>Hosting this series of international meetings highlights the leadership role that Australia plays, and the ALA is grateful to the individuals and teams that have put such a strong foundation in place over more than a decade. These partnerships also highlight the importance of international collaboration in improving the national biodiversity data landscape, and ultimately our ability to understand, conserve and enhance the world\u2019s biodiversity. I\u2019m grateful to our team and our fellow CSIRO colleagues who played such an important role in hosting and welcoming our international guests to Australia.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"

Cassowaries are the second heaviest birds in the world (after ostriches), with females reaching a maximum weight of 55kgs and males up to 76kgs! They lay bright green eggs, with dads stepping up to be in charge of incubation and chick rearing. Once the eggs hatch, baby cassowaries can walk almost immediately with their strong back legs. Babies are not born with their signature black plumage, instead have banded yellow and brown striped patterning as chicks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"967\" height=\"649\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48811\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC.jpg 967w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC-768x515.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius<\/em>) chick.

Cassowaries are notorious for communicating through deep rumbles, hisses and grunting sounds. Cassowaries use various vocalisations to communicate through their dense rainforest habitats. If you hear a cassowary calling, make sure you keep your distance. Equipped with a razor-sharp beak, talons and a particularly territorial nature, cassowaries are more than capable of tearing through flesh if they feel threatened. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keystone species<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cassowaries are \u2018keystone species\u2019 &#8211; species which has a disproportionately important role in their natural ecosystems. In rainforest habitats across northern QLD, cassowaries play a critical role in dispersing many native seeds through fragmented rainforest landscapes. Due to their large size, cassowaries can swallow fruits and other plants whole, digest the pulp and excrete seeds intact in dung piles (aka natural fertilisers). This ability to disperse large seeds helps to maintain healthy ecosystems by promoting vegetation regeneration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better illustrate how cassowaries support native plant dispersal across rainforest ecosystems, Callum and Shandiya from the ALA Science and Decision Support team have created an interactive map. The map shows 15 native plant species across the QLD wet tropics against cassowary records in the ALA!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\">Check out the interactive map!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"534\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1024x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48855\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1024x534.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-300x156.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-768x400.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1536x801.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-2048x1068.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1920x1001.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about native seeds in tropical areas, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ath.org.au\/\">Australian Topical Herbarium<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#WorldCassowaryDay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Celebrating #WorldCassowaryDay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":48857,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48809"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48856,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809\/revisions\/48856"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/48857"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48809"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48809"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48809"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
