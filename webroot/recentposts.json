The project has doubled the number of echidna records in the ALA and discovered new facts about echidna biology. Echidna CSI encourages the public to take photos of echidnas around Australia and collect their scats for DNA and hormone analysis. Over the past<br>three years, thousands of participants have recorded more than 12,000 echidna sightings. This is the largest dataset collected by any project for echidnas. The data is providing valuable information on wild populations\u2019 habitat, diet and health including insights into the impact of  ushfires on echidna microbiomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"study-the-shy-echidna-challenge-accepted\">Study the shy Echidna? Challenge accepted<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Echidnas are notoriously shy and difficult to see in the wild, and prior to Echidna CSI they were considered pretty difficult (and expensive) to  tudy. As a result, although echidnas are iconic  native species and threatened by feral animals, habitat loss and road collisions, many aspects of wild populations including their distribution, biology and population trends were largely unknown. The Echidna CSI project brought<br>together ecologists, molecular researchers and computer scientists from the University of Adelaide, the Atlas of Living Australia\u2019s biodiversity data infrastructure, and Australia\u2019s citizen science community to fill the gaps in our knowledge about echidnas. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Echidna-CSI_image-by-Cecilia_webster-1024x794.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-45447\" width=\"561\" height=\"435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Echidna-CSI_image-by-Cecilia_webster-1024x794.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Echidna-CSI_image-by-Cecilia_webster-300x233.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Echidna-CSI_image-by-Cecilia_webster-768x595.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Echidna-CSI_image-by-Cecilia_webster-1536x1191.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Echidna-CSI_image-by-Cecilia_webster-1920x1488.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Echidna-CSI_image-by-Cecilia_webster.jpg 2015w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" \/><figcaption>Using Echidna CSI citizen scientists can upload sightings of Echidnas <br>from all over Australia.

All observations flow automatically into the ALA. The project has robust quality assurance processes built into it to ensure all records are verified, research-grade data points.  The research team also have access to all citizen scientist echidna observations in the ALA uploaded via other applications such as iNaturalist. The Echidna CSI app is customised to the project and designed to guide users into collecting information that will be of most use. It also includes fun facts about echidnas so users can learn more about this iconic Australian species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-app-has-huge-impact-for-echidna-research-and-conservation\">Mobile app has huge impact for echidna research and conservation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By combining novel science with citizen science, the Echidna CSI citizen science project has highlighted the extraordinary power of the citizen<br>science approach. More than 11,000 people have contributed to the Echidna CSI project. These citizen scientists have eyes on the ground in<br>many locations and have contributed sightings and genetic material from all states and territories including throughout protected areas and remote places. The research team could never have surveyed such a large area without the help of the Echidna CSI community contributors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ALA infrastructure has been crucial in advancing echidna research and making the data, and data visualisations, accessible and open. This has resulted in the ability to leverage translational research, such as examining the impact of fire on echidna populations and diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"assessing-echidna-populations-after-the-2019-20-bushfires\">Assessing echidna populations after the 2019-20 bushfires<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All echidna records collected before the 2019-2020 bushfire season served as crucial baseline information to monitor and assess the health of echidna populations post fire. Echidna CSI has conducted some local scale research in fire impacted areas and is documenting a change in echidna microbiomes in areas such as Kangaroo Island in South Australia. This subspecies of echidnas is listed as endangered, so the more we can learn about their response to fire the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"research-impact\">Research impact<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2351989421001761\">Echidna CSI \u2013 Improving monitoring of a cryptic species at continental scale using Citizen Science<\/a>.

Since its initial release in July, thousands of download requests have been made using <strong>galah<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new version (1.3.1) brings two exciting features to <strong>galah <\/strong>for the first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"range-queries-now-possible\"><strong>Range queries now possible<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, this version supports \u2018range queries\u2019; that is, the capacity to state that you want values that are above or below a particular value. This makes it simple to state that you want all records after a particular year, or above a particular elevation. Combined with the ability to specify Boolean queries (such as AND, OR, NOT), this version of <strong>galah <\/strong>is a major upgrade. See the \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/atlasoflivingaustralia.github.io\/galah\/reference\/select_filters.html\">select_filters<\/a>\u2019 page for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"search-taxonomic-data-stored-by-the-ala\"><strong>Search taxonomic data stored by the ALA<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, and more importantly, version 1.3.1 introduces the <strong>ala_taxonomy() <\/strong>function. This function provides a new way to search through the taxonomic hierarchy within the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxonomic information downloaded using <strong>ala_taxonomy()<\/strong> is now returned as a taxonomic tree. This capability enables users to search for which lower clades are contained within a specified taxon. For example, users can find all clades at the family rank that stem from the class \u201cMammalia\u201d. They can also search down to a number of other less formal taxonomic sub-ranks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxonomic trees preserve ranks within their data structure, offering new opportunities to create data visualisations that harness this information.

With the ALA&#8217;s infrastructure growing in excess of millions of biodiversity occurrence records annually, such efficiencies are critical. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Javier Molina, ALA\u2019s Core Infrastructure Upgrade Project Lead, was pleased to report that users have noticed the system is more responsive, particularly when searching species data, using map-based navigation, and using the Spatial Portal (ALA\u2019s analytical tool).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cPrior to the upgrade, we were experiencing some unscheduled outages every month. Since the project went live in June, we haven\u2019t received any reports of unscheduled outages. The system has also coped well with high peaks of utilisation,\u201d said Javier.<\/p><p>\u201cWe recently ingested a dataset from eBird Australia of more than 20 million records, this went smoothy and without issue. A dataset that large would have created lots of headaches for us in the old system.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"consistency-is-key\"><strong>Consistency is key<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency between the ALA, GBIF and other biodiversity infrastructures is another component of the recent upgrade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many users of the ALA also frequently access data through GBIF.

For example, if there are consistent flags and interpretations, users become comfortable and proficient using multiple platforms. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"international-living-atlases-will-also-benefit-from-upgrade\"><strong>International Living Atlases will also benefit from upgrade<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Software originally developed by the Atlas of Living Australia team is increasingly used across the GBIF network.
