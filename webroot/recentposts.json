At first, I wanted to go straight into work once I finished my undergraduate degree, but now, I\u2019m considering completing either a Masters or PhD in something related to environmental science. I\u2019ve always had a strong connection to the land and ocean as well as a curiosity for the natural world. It became clearer to me as I got older that an environmental science degree would foster these values of mine and potentially let me make an impact.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: What made you apply for the Indigenous Studentship Internship program?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I heard about ALA internships from some friends at UNSW who participated in another internship program. From there I investigated whether the ALA offered internships over the summer and stumbled upon the Indigenous Studentship program. I applied because I wanted to see what it was like to apply the skills I\u2019ve learned at university in industry.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Q: What did your ALA internship project focus on?<br><em>My project focused on invasive species and how they have moved around over time. At first, I was interested in species&#8217; ranges shifting as a way to cope with climate change. This then led into this idea of changing species distributions and how quickly invasive species can spread within Australia. I also helped with the galah python package development which involved writing tests, finding bugs and helping to design its website.<\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: What was a new skill that that you learned through the program that you\u2019re proud of and what were some challenges that you faced during your project?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Coming into this internship I had never really done any data visualisation before. Now I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on how to code figures in Python and have been able to produce some aesthetic plots that I\u2019m super proud of.  While coding my data visualisations, I ran into a lot of bugs which is always challenging as sometimes it would take an entire day to try fix. I also was using Python to make data visualisations while the rest of the team predominantly used R. This meant I had to figure out a lot of the bugs on my own which was challenging but also a useful skill to develop.<\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q: Tell us about your highlight of the internship program? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The highlight of the internship for me would definitely have to be the people I worked with. They were all so amazing and friendly and just made my experience here so fun that I\u2019m a bit sad to be leaving<\/em>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations Caitlin on successfully completing your project with the ALA!

We are also grateful to the independent review panel chaired by Professor David Cantrill for their work in reviewing proposals and selecting a fantastic suite of final recipients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DenisSmith_110613_IMG_4630_LR-1-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47969\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DenisSmith_110613_IMG_4630_LR-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DenisSmith_110613_IMG_4630_LR-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DenisSmith_110613_IMG_4630_LR-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/01\/DenisSmith_110613_IMG_4630_LR-1.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Leanne Wheaton working on collections specimens at South Australia Museum, Photo Credit Denis Smith, South Australia Museum. <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 grant round for the Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program will open for applications in&nbsp;<strong>March 2023<\/strong>.

I hadn\u2019t realised how exhausting it was to balance study, work, and learning Python. However, creating a structured routine has helped significantly with managing my time. It was great to have this opportunity to further develop time-management skills ahead of my honours project.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q) What was your highlight of the internship program?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A) The highlight of my internship program was seeing the maps load properly on the test server. Initially, I had many issues that had caused the maps I uploaded to not show up. Once I had figured out what I had done wrong, fixed the issues, and tried uploading again, I felt very relieved to see that the maps were loading properly. After the issues were ironed out, the rest of the datasets were straight-forward.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See what Elijah created below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1015\" height=\"980\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Elijah-Lorikeet-Map.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47738\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Elijah-Lorikeet-Map.png 1015w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Elijah-Lorikeet-Map-300x290.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Elijah-Lorikeet-Map-768x742.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Occurrence records of Rainbow Lorikeets <em>(Trichoglossus moluccanus<\/em>) from 2020 onwards against its expert distribution map provided by BirdLife Australia.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-medium is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Thai-2022-intern-ALA-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47731\" width=\"383\" height=\"385\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Thai Rushbrook &#8211;  Data Visualisation intern<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Thai is studying a Bachelor of Fine Arts and Science majoring in Photography &amp; Ecology.<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q) What made you apply for the 2022 ALA Internship program?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A)<em>&nbsp;My university posted a list of internship positions available, and the ALA was on there! I\u2019d heard of the ALA before and thought the data analysis\/visualization combination suited my interests really well.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q) What did your ALA internship project focus on?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A<em>) My project focused on the number of ducks recorded in greater Melbourne in the COVID-19 lockdown periods of 2020-2021. I was comparing them to \u2018normal\u2019 years, 2017-2019, to see if there was any difference.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q) What was a new skill you learned through the program that you\u2019re proud of?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A)&nbsp;<em>I started the term with very basic R-Studio skills, so I learnt a lot about R by organising data, transforming it, and creating the actual visualisations. I think I learnt more R-Studio tricks in this one term than the rest of my degree to date!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q) What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A)<em>\u00a0Initially I was so nervous I didn\u2019t have the skills needed to make a great project, so it took me a while to get started. Once I gained a little confidence, I was able to get creative and I\u2019m very happy with the results.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q) What was your highlight of the internship program?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A<em>) Coming together with the other interns at the end of the term to see what they had been working on was amazing.
