Despite progress, women are still under-represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines all over the world. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/observances\/women-and-girls-in-science-day\">In 2022<\/a>, just 31 per cent of researchers globally were women. And women make up only 35% of science graduates globally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Australia the proportion of STEM enrolments from women has remained stable at 37 per cent since 2020. Women remained underrepresented in enrolments and completions for engineering and IT. The proportion of women in STEM-qualified occupations has remained at 15 per cent from 2021 to 2024, compared to 50 per cent in non-STEM occupations. Find out more in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.industry.gov.au\/publications\/stem-equity-monitor#workforce-data\">STEM Equity Monitor<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked ALA team members to share their stories about a woman in science they find inspiring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"purnima-devi-barman\">Purnima Devi Barman<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Shandiya Balasubramaniam, Decision Support Program Lead<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/storksister\/?hl=en\">Dr Purnima Devi Barman<\/a> is a wildlife conservation biologist from Assam, India, whose work has transformed how communities care for one of the world\u2019s most threatened birds, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/taxa\/4751-Leptoptilos-dubius\">greater adjutant stork<\/a> (<em>Leptoptilos dubius<\/em>). Locally known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/taxa\/4751-Leptoptilos-dubius\/browse_photos\">the hargila<\/a>, these birds were once considered bad omens, and it was common for nesting trees to be cut down and nests destroyed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Barman worked directly with women in the local communities to change perceptions of the stork, offering an alternative image of these birds as symbols of joy. She engaged women to incorporate stork motifs into the fabrics they were already weaving, hoping to create an appreciation for these birds. This grew into multiple small businesses producing textiles, clothing, and artworks featuring the stork, many of which are now sold internationally. Alongside raising the profile of the stork globally, this work has led to the establishment of sewing schools locally, providing training, income, and new vocational opportunities for women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of this effort is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/the_hargila_army_\/?hl=en\">the Hargila Army<\/a>, an all-women conservation network founded by Dr Barman that has been central to the stork\u2019s recovery. Now comprising more than 20,000 women across over 40 villages, the Hargila Army protects nesting trees, rescues injured birds, and celebrates the stork through festivals, songs, and traditional weaving. Through this community-led approach, people\u2019s sense of stewardship of the species has grown and the hargila is now proudly celebrated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This inspirational campaign shows the power of a multi-pronged approach to conservation, combining ecological management with art, design, and culture to holistically support the long-term conservation of a species. Dr Barman\u2019s work has been internationally recognised through numerous awards, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/whitleyaward.org\/2025\/02\/20\/dr-purnima-devi-barman-named-time-woman-of-the-year-2025\/\">the Whitley Gold Award<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unep.org\/championsofearth\/laureates\/2022\/dr-purnima-devi-barman\">UN Champion of the Earth Award<\/a>, and more recently in 2025 she was named one of <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/collections\/women-of-the-year\/7216405\/purnima-devi-barman-hargila-storks\/\">TIME\u2019s Women of the Year.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"An army of women are rescuing an entire bird species in India\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WfglmGkTUr8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lucyna-kania\"><strong>Lucyna Kania<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Juliet Seers, Training and Outreach Coordinator<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lucy is inspiring because she shows that science doesn\u2019t have to be tied only to journals or university settings to matter. As a wildlife ecologist and photographer, she brings attention to insects and other invertebrates that are critical to how ecosystems function but rarely get public attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, through her role in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2024-09-09\/wildlife-photographers-discover-mam-burrumurl-ghost-wasp-nt\/104321586\">discovery of a new species of ghost wasp<\/a> in the Northern Territory, the Mam-Burrumurl wasp (<em>Gasteruption mamburrumurl<\/em>). Lucy was one of the individuals who first <a href=\"https:\/\/nit.com.au\/09-09-2024\/13609\/mam-burrumurl-new-species-of-ghost-wasp-discovered-in-the-nt\">found the wasp in the field<\/a> (which was later formally described by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.taxonomyaustralia.org.au\/ajt\/papers\/j2iqgsdncv\">Ben Parslow from the South Australian Museum<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, she worked closely with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jawoyn.org.au\/\">Jawoyn Traditional Owners<\/a> to help develop a culturally appropriate name using traditional language, this shows how science can be respectful and inclusive. Lucy makes a real effort to demonstrate that every species has a story worth telling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her impact also comes from expanding what a career in science can look like, and who it can reach. Lucy has contributed to major public-facing projects, including filming for Netflix\u2019s Our Great National Parks in Kakadu, partnering with ABC Science and ABC Darwin to highlight unique Top End species, and co-curating the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.magnt.net.au\/tinyterritory\">MAGNT exhibition Tiny Territory<\/a> with her partner Nick Volpe, celebrating the region\u2019s extraordinary insect life. These projects show that influencing how people value biodiversity often happens through storytelling and imagery, not data alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently through her work at the <a href=\"https:\/\/manubio.org\/\">Manu Bio Station in Peru<\/a>, Lucy continues to collaborate with local communities to survey and document biodiversity in one of the most species-rich places on Earth. For people early in their careers, or those who don\u2019t fit the traditional academic mould, her work is a clear reminder that there are many ways to belong in science, and that real change happens when research connects with people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2026\/02\/Lucyna-Kania_fieldwork_instagram-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51297\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2026\/02\/Lucyna-Kania_fieldwork_instagram-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2026\/02\/Lucyna-Kania_fieldwork_instagram-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2026\/02\/Lucyna-Kania_fieldwork_instagram.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lucynak.wild\/?hl=en\">Lucyna Kania, Instagram<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"judith-love-cohen\">Judith Love Cohen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Kylie Morrow, Digital Product Specialist<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"284\" height=\"351\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2026\/02\/Judith_Love_Cohen_1959-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2026\/02\/Judith_Love_Cohen_1959-1.jpg 284w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2026\/02\/Judith_Love_Cohen_1959-1-243x300.jpg 243w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image credit: Judith Love Cohen with the Pioneer spacecraft (1959). <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Judith_Love_Cohen,_1959.jpg\">Photo\/Look magazine<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/allthatsinteresting.com\/judith-love-cohen\">Judith Love Cohen<\/a> (1933-2016) was an aerospace engineer whose determination to pursue mathematics and engineering in the 1950s and 60s led to contributions that saved lives on the Apollo 13 space mission. Thankfully, Cohen ignored her high school guidance counsellor\u2019s advice to attend &#8220;a nice finishing school and learn to be a lady&#8221;, and instead pursued her childhood dream to reach for the stars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in primary school, Cohen was talented at mathematics \u2013 classmates were paying her to complete their maths homework for them. Fast forwarding to university, Cohen initially studied mathematics before <a href=\"https:\/\/viterbischool.usc.edu\/news\/2016\/07\/in-memory-of-judith-love-cohen-mother-wife-friend-author-engineer\/\">earning her bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s degrees in electrical engineering from USC<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, Cohen joined Space Technology Laboratories (later TRW) where she worked on the Abort-Guidance System for the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module. This backup navigation system was designed to take over in an emergency, and in April 1970, it did exactly that, guiding the Apollo 13 astronauts safely back to Earth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cohen&#8217;s dedication to her work was extraordinary. Famously, on August 28, 1969, while in labour with her fourth child, she stopped by her office to collect a computer printout of a problem she&#8217;d been working on. Later that day, she called her boss from the hospital to report she&#8217;d solved the problem\u2026 and also gave birth to a healthy baby \u2013 who would grow up to be the famous actor and musician, Jack Black!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Apollo, Cohen worked on the Tracking and Data Relay System Satellite, which operated in orbit for nearly 40 years, and led systems engineering for the science ground facility of the Hubble Space Telescope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout her career, Cohen was a strong advocate for inclusion and equality in the workplace, and after retiring from engineering in the 1990s, she continued this legacy, authoring &#8220;You Can Be a Woman Engineer&#8221; and co-publishing over 20 books encouraging girls to pursue careers in science, technology, and other non-traditional fields.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we\u2019re celebrating International Day of Women and Girls in Science.

Photo: Isaac Clarey, CC BY-NC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p>Taxonomy is the science of naming, describing and classifying organisms. It\u2019s the basis for how data in the ALA are organised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Species taxonomy is continuously evolving based on new scientific discoveries (new species being described), as well as techniques such as genetic sequencing, bioinformatics and advanced imaging which can change the way researchers understand existing species leading to re-classification and new names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past two years, we have been changing and cleaning up our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.ala.org.au\/support\/solutions\/articles\/6000261677-taxonomy-in-the-ala\">ALA taxonomic backbone<\/a>. The first stage was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/whats-in-a-name-refreshing-the-ala-taxonomy\/\">taxonomic backbone refresh<\/a> we released in 2024. Now, we are replacing that with a brand new backbone that should make it easier for our users to navigate and find the species information they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest change should be almost invisible to our users \u2013 we\u2019ve spent 12 months identifying and removing duplicates and unnecessary names, and correctly linking synonyms (different names for the same species) that were previously unlinked (being treated as different species). This reduced the number of species names in the ALA down from 283,000 to 218,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next stage was to look at the 9 million records that either didn\u2019t match to the taxonomic backbone or matched at higher taxonomic levels. Quite often these are as a result of spelling errors in the scientific names on observations, the use of common names instead of scientific names and other issues. We\u2019ve directed many of these records to the correct species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a consequence, this has redirected around another 2 million records to the correct species. More importantly, these changes have added the first data for over 10,000 species. And, for over 4,000 species, correctly redirected records have increased their number of records by more than 40%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our new backbone taxonomy now matches to 99% of all statutory and state lists. Ultimately this update makes our taxonomy more accurate and our records easier to search and use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what else is different? To make that clearer, we\u2019ll need to go through how data is structured in the backbone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-are-species-structured-in-the-ala\">How are species structured in the ALA?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA taxonomic backbone is based on the <a href=\"https:\/\/biodiversity.org.au\/nsl\/\">National Species List (NSL)<\/a>. Because the ALA includes herbarium data (plants and fungi) from New Zealand and because we also cover groups that the NSL does not cover (eg bacteria and viruses), we also draw names from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nzor.org.nz\/\">New Zealand Organism Register (NZOR)<\/a> as well as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.catalogueoflife.org\/\">Catalogue of Life (CoL)<\/a>. Previously, these have been merged together automatically.<br>Our 2024 backbone refresh made big changes to remove duplication of species listings and improve accuracy and navigation when searching for new species or threatened species records in the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-the-2025-changes\">What are the 2025 changes?<\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Cape-York-Graceful-Tree-Frog-Ranoidea-bella-Photo-Credit-Mark-Simpson-CC-BY-NC-1-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51113\" style=\"width:328px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Cape-York-Graceful-Tree-Frog-Ranoidea-bella-Photo-Credit-Mark-Simpson-CC-BY-NC-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Cape-York-Graceful-Tree-Frog-Ranoidea-bella-Photo-Credit-Mark-Simpson-CC-BY-NC-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Cape-York-Graceful-Tree-Frog-Ranoidea-bella-Photo-Credit-Mark-Simpson-CC-BY-NC-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Cape-York-Graceful-Tree-Frog-Ranoidea-bella-Photo-Credit-Mark-Simpson-CC-BY-NC-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Cape-York-Graceful-Tree-Frog-Ranoidea-bella-Photo-Credit-Mark-Simpson-CC-BY-NC-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Cape-York-Graceful-Tree-Frog-Ranoidea-bella-Photo-Credit-Mark-Simpson-CC-BY-NC-1-1920x1920.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Cape-York-Graceful-Tree-Frog-Ranoidea-bella-Photo-Credit-Mark-Simpson-CC-BY-NC-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Cape York Graceful Treefrog (<em>Chlorohyla bella<\/em>). Photo: Mark Simpson, CC BY-NC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve made some big, but less visible changes. The most obvious change is that we\u2019ve updated the taxonomy to include all species described, as at June 2025. We have also simplified the Tree of Life (like a family tree showing how species are related using a structure with classifications such as Kingdom, Phylum, Class etc) to remove high-level duplications that result from us combining different sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, instead of just merging sources together we \u201cadd\u201d species that are not in the NSL. It\u2019s a more targeted and curated approach. This is particularly important for New Zealand plants and fungi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big change is that we\u2019ve added the <a href=\"https:\/\/algae.biodiversity.org.au\/nsl\/services\/search\/names?publication=Kuetzing%2C+F.T.+%281865%29%2C+Tabulae+Phycologicae&amp;search=true&amp;advanced=true&amp;display=apni\">Australian Algal Names Index<\/a>, adding around 11,000 species. We\u2019ve previously relied on an international source for algal names and that did not load properly last time. We\u2019ve also changed fungi, bryophytes and protista so that we are only taking names from NZOR and NSL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve also removed a lot of species that were \u201cinternational\u201d particularly in groups like Protists. In the short term this will mean that some groups, such as slime moulds \u2013 where we were reliant on international sources \u2013 will only be represented at a higher level in the ALA until we can develop a better solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of quite major taxonomic changes have recently been published, since June 2025. Where we haven\u2019t been able to include these (too late in the process and too big a change to the NSL), we\u2019ve referenced these newly described species or new genera back to the names as recorded in the NSL. For example, all the new genera in the tree frogs are referenced back to <em>Litoria<\/em> (the previous genus that contained all Australian tree frogs).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While birds have millions of records, many species in the ALA have few or no records, so it is essential to get as many records matching as possible. The 2025 changes add around 59,000 records to 2,549 species that previously had fewer than 100 records each.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Blotch-tailed-earless-dragon_Travis-W-Reeder.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51112\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1.499285782306447;width:439px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Blotch-tailed-earless-dragon_Travis-W-Reeder.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Blotch-tailed-earless-dragon_Travis-W-Reeder-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/12\/Blotch-tailed-earless-dragon_Travis-W-Reeder-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Pebble Dragon (<em>Tympanocryptis cephalus<\/em>).

Reeder, CC BY-NC<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-still-remains-to-be-done\">What still remains to be done?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A big issue we still need to deal with is where a species is split into multiple species. For example, the pebble dragon (<em>Tympanocryptis cephalus<\/em>) had a number of new species described within it, including <em>Tympanocryptis gigas<\/em> and <em>T. diabolicus<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that, as with most aggregated databases such as the state and territory government atlases, records are placed based on the species names used in the data or what the species was named at the time it was recorded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if a record with a scientific name of <em>T. cephalus<\/em> comes in that is actually <em>T. gigas<\/em>, there is no way to place this correctly as <em>T. gigas<\/em> (currently).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll initially be looking at a way of flagging species with users so that you will know to look at more than one species to get the full picture. Down the track, we hope to place these records but flag them so our users know they have been placed automatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big challenge is to develop a better approach to names-matching. When data comes into the ALA, the species names in the data are matched automatically to the most correct place. This system is not perfect. This is not just the programming in the ALA; species names themselves cause problems. For example, there are over 5,000 homonyms in the ALA (identical species names for unrelated species). We hope to improve names-matching over the next 12 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All changes to the ALA taxonomic backbone have been actioned in consultation with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dcceew.gov.au\/science-research\/abrs\">Australian Biological Resources Study<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anbg.gov.au\/cpbr\/program\/hc\/hc-APC.html\">Australian Plant Census.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Your hip bone&#8217;s connected to your back bone&#8221; goes the old song, but did you know the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) uses a backbone as well?

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) brings together countries from around the world to share and connect data that helps us understand and protect nature. The discussions this year focused on how we can keep this global network strong and sustainable, while embracing new technologies like environmental DNA and advanced data standards. These innovations will make biodiversity information richer and more useful for conservation, science, and policy worldwide. Shortly after this meeting I participated in the international <a href=\"https:\/\/www.livingdata2025.com\/\">Living Data Conference<\/a>, which provided an opportunity to engage more broadly with the international biodiversity data and infrastructure community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), we play a leading role in this global effort. Our participation ensures Australian biodiversity data contributes to international programs\u2014and that we benefit from data collected elsewhere, which is vital for research and biosecurity. We also explored opportunities to strengthen partnerships across Oceania, support Indigenous data governance, and collaborate on cutting-edge tools that will shape the future of biodiversity science. By staying connected and sharing knowledge, Australia helps drive global solutions for nature while delivering real benefits at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversations in Bogot\u00e1 highlighted that biodiversity data is more than just numbers\u2014it\u2019s the foundation for tackling global challenges like climate change and species loss. Australia has a chance to lead by example, not only through our technical expertise but also by fostering collaboration across the region. Continued engagement will help ensure that our scientists, policymakers, and communities have the best possible information to protect and enhance biodiversity for future generations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d like to acknowledge the work of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gbif.org\/\">GBIF<\/a>), the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.humboldt.org.co\/\">Colombian<\/a> hosts of Living Data, and our partners from the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (<a href=\"https:\/\/geobon.org\/\">GEOBON<\/a>), Biodiversity Information Standards (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tdwg.org\/\">TDWG<\/a>) and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (<a href=\"https:\/\/obis.org\/\">OBIS<\/a>) who made the events in Bogota so successful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to all our partners, users and stakeholders and I wish everyone an enjoyable summer break and festive season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Andre Zerger<br>ALA Director<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Australia Partners Globally to Unlock Biodiversity Data<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4602,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-51044","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-blogs-news"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/51044","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4602"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=51044"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/51044\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":51072,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/51044\/revisions\/51072"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=51044"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=51044"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=51044"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
