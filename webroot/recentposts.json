This group includes species such as the ostrich, rhea, kiwi, cassowary and tinamou. The ratites are one of the most pre-historic groups of birds, in part because they are highly adaptable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emus have persisted in Australia through thousands of years; but anecdotal evidence suggests they are less common than they used to be. Increasing urbanisation and the removal of emus from farming lands means this species isn\u2019t as widespread as it once was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With populations condensing we begin to ask where will be the safe haven for emus in the future? It turns out answering this simple question is harder than you\u2019d think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every species has an area across which it can be found \u2013 a \u2018geographic distribution\u2019. Knowing exactly where this is helps us develop an understanding of the species, how it may adapt over time, and assist in decision making about conservation. For example, if a species only lives in a small area, it may be of larger concern compared to species that can be found all over the country, across a wide range of habitats and climates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia\u2019s climate has changed over many thousands of years, and the species that live here have moved with it. The country has been subject to long periods where it was wetter or drier, and where sea levels were lower or higher. This begged a series of questions &#8211; how have emus adapted to these changes, being one of the most pre-historic species? What effect have these changes had on where emus can live? How will this change with further human impact on the environment?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Emu-study-figure-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44779\" width=\"495\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Emu-study-figure-4.jpg 657w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Emu-study-figure-4-300x223.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" \/><figcaption>Predicted distribution change from ensemble models, across Australia and the Great Dividing Range region, past to present and present to future.

SDMs take maps of where an animal has been seen and combines them with information about the environment at these locations, such as the climate (temperature and rainfall) and habitat (e.g. vegetation available and land uses). These combine to make a \u2018prediction map\u2019 of where a species can be found. The more sightings of a species there are, the more accurate these maps are likely to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, Emus are one of the most easily identified species and people love taking pictures of them! In fact, citizen scientists routinely record between 5,000 and 30,000 emu sightings every year across Australia. These sightings are collected and stored in a single place \u2013the Atlas of Living Australia (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\">https:\/\/www.ala.org.au<\/a>). Here, they can be freely viewed and downloaded by anyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these data, we built a model that shows the climate and habitat that emus prefer today; where suitable climate was 6,000 years ago; and where it will be in 50 years\u2019 time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found that in the past 6,000 years, emus have made vast shifts inland across central Australia. These shifts have been driven mostly by climate, with emus minimally influenced by environmental factors such as habitat type, distance from water, land use types or fire frequency. These changes have greatly expanded the emu\u2019s range and are predicted to remain stable over the next 50 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, however, emus have progressively been lost from the east coast. Now on the edge of their climatically suitable range, east coast emus are likely to be more susceptible to other threats, such as poor reproductive success due to predation by feral animals on the eggs and chicks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-1024x574.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44780\" width=\"444\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-1024x574.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image-768x430.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/06\/emu-camera-trap-image.jpg 1099w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" \/><figcaption>Camera trap image of emu feeding from an east coast population. Image credit: Julia Ryeland<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Emu disappearance across the east coast is unlikely to make the species vulnerable to the threat of extinction, because of the stability of their overall expansive range. However, the local extinction of emu populations across the east coast could have ecosystem wide implications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emus can travel up to 100km a year and move the seeds of native plants huge distances with them as they go. Without emus, many plant species will find it harder to disperse to new habitats or share genetic material between isolated plant communities. Combined with other threats such as habitat loss and predation by introduced species, our east coast plant communities could soon be in trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as poignant, though, is the importance of emus in Australian culture, both in European and Indigenous histories. The emu is a totem to many indigenous groups and is shown on the Australian coat of arms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the east coast where urbanisation is progressing rapidly, encountering a species such as the emu gives many Australian\u2019s an important connection to nature that can help inspire conservation efforts for our lesser known, declining fauna.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, read the full journal article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-020-79551-0\">Past and future potential range changes in one of the last large vertebrates of the Australian continent, the emu\u00a0<em>Dromaius novaehollandiae<\/em><\/a> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Julia Ryeland, Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44778,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44776"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44776"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44776\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44783,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44776\/revisions\/44783"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44778"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44776"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44776"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44776"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":44748,"date":"2021-05-25T16:34:46","date_gmt":"2021-05-25T06:34:46","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=44748"},"modified":"2021-05-26T12:17:00","modified_gmt":"2021-05-26T02:17:00","slug":"directors-message-may-2021","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/directors-message-may-2021\/","title":{"rendered":"Director&#8217;s message &#8211; May 2021"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44152\" width=\"154\" height=\"154\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 154px) 100vw, 154px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d like to welcome you to the May 2021 edition of our newsletter in which&nbsp;we profile a number of exciting developments&nbsp;in&nbsp;the ALA.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, it\u2019s a&nbsp;pleasure&nbsp;to be releasing&nbsp;the&nbsp;ALA\u2019s&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/ALA-Workplan-2021-22_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">annual work&nbsp;plan&nbsp;for&nbsp;2021-22<\/a>.&nbsp;Mid-last year we were excited to&nbsp;release&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/ALA-Strategy-2020-25-Public-June-6-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ALA Strategy 2020-25<\/a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;work&nbsp;plan provides an&nbsp;annual&nbsp;view into ALA priorities as articulated primarily through projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work&nbsp;plan is an&nbsp;outcome&nbsp;of&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;stakeholder conversations, the insight of the ALA leadership team and&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;from the ALA Advisory Board. It details a range of projects including&nbsp;major activities such as:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>an extension&nbsp;to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/ala-upgrade-on-its-way\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Core Infrastructure Upgrade&nbsp;Project<\/a>&nbsp;working&nbsp;with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;a strategic shift to support more complex biodiversity data&nbsp;<\/li><li>our&nbsp;three&nbsp;Australian Research Data Commons&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;projects&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ardc.edu.au\/project\/ecoassets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EcoAssets<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/improving-access-to-sensitive-species-data\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sensitive Species Data Pathways<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ardc.edu.au\/project\/ecocommons-australia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EcoCommons&nbsp;Australia<\/a>, and&nbsp;<\/li><li>more tactical activities such as an uplift&nbsp;of&nbsp;the ALA\u2019s&nbsp;R software&nbsp;suite&nbsp;and enhancements to our Biodiversity Information Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA has historically focussed on harmonising Australia\u2019s biodiversity data pertaining to native plants and animals, and providing related data products and services to our key users across research, government, industry and community. However, we are increasingly seeing the value of our infrastructure in supporting biosecurity-related applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this issue we highlight our partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment\u2019s Chief Environmental Biosecurity Office, which has been able to leverage a decade of ALA data partnerships and robust infrastructure to support the development of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/ala-helps-to-stop-pests-in-their-tracks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">novel biosecurity alert capability<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a pressing need for an improved national approach for dealing with biosecurity data.&nbsp;I was reminded of this earlier this week with the Government\u2019s release of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.environment.gov.au\/biodiversity\/threatened\/publications\/threatened-species-strategy-2021-2031\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Threatened Species Strategy<\/a>&nbsp;where again we see the importance of understanding the distribution of invasive species, and the importance of&nbsp; knowledge and tools in supporting our mitigation programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a world of citizen science apps, biosecurity-related research programs,&nbsp;and government programs capturing data pertaining to species of biosecurity concern. Harmonising these data&nbsp;into a national data infrastructure will become an increasingly strategically important part of ALA\u2019s work program.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s\u00a0also\u00a0been a\u00a0tremendous few months\u00a0with respect to team growth. We\u2019ve welcomed two new data analysts to the ALA, working under Dr Martin Westgate, and in coming weeks we\u2019ll welcome an R-developer to work alongside our partner\u00a0EcoCommons\u00a0program.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our uplift in data analytics capability\u00a0will\u00a0provide improved ALA data support to external stakeholders, projects and partners. The new\u00a0team members will complement our existing data\u00a0management\u00a0team\u00a0responsible for liaising with our data partners to bring data into the\u00a0ALA. They\u00a0will\u00a0provide customised data services to our partners and support the next partnership opportunity that arises.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy the May&nbsp;2021&nbsp;edition of our&nbsp;newsletter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019d like to welcome you to the May 2021 edition of our newsletter in which&nbsp;we profile a number of exciting developments&nbsp;in&nbsp;the ALA.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it\u2019s a&nbsp;pleasure&nbsp;to be releasing&nbsp;the&nbsp;ALA\u2019s&nbsp;annual work&nbsp;plan&nbsp;for&nbsp;2021-22.&nbsp;Mid-last year we were excited to&nbsp;release&nbsp;&nbsp;ALA Strategy 2020-25&nbsp;and the&nbsp;work&nbsp;plan provides an&nbsp;annual&nbsp;view into ALA priorities as articulated primarily through projects.&nbsp;&nbsp; The work&nbsp;plan is an&nbsp;outcome&nbsp;of&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;stakeholder conversations, the insight of the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44152,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44748"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44748"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44748\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44759,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44748\/revisions\/44759"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44152"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44748"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44748"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44748"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
