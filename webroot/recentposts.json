I was also able to work on a few different tasks for the duration of the NISP program such as assisting in the development of <a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\">galah-python<\/a> which improved upon my software development skills. The NISP program also allowed me to become more confident in my skillset and learn how to approach and solve novel problems, which are all useful in helping me to complete my day-to-day tasks within the ARGA team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What made you want to come back to CSIRO as a full-time employee after your internship?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had an absolute deadly time during my internship mainly due to the stimulating and rewarding work I was undertaking but even more so because of the friendly and welcoming people I got to work with.

In 2015, a mysterious virus swept through the Bellinger River in northern New South Wales, wiping out a staggering 90% of the critically endangered <a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/https:\/biodiversity.org.au\/afd\/taxa\/e8b0899e-0148-45ba-b2eb-2c42c3ad3d96\">Bellinger River Snapping Turtle (<\/a><em><a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/https:\/biodiversity.org.au\/afd\/taxa\/e8b0899e-0148-45ba-b2eb-2c42c3ad3d96\">Myuchelys georgesi)<\/a> <\/em>population. This devastating event highlighted the urgent need for large-scale freshwater turtle conservation efforts. Researchers from leading Australian universities knew traditional methods wouldn&#8217;t suffice. They needed a way to harness the power of the public, a way to give everyone a voice in turtle conservation. Enter citizen science, and the innovative 1MT project was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49463\" style=\"width:1001px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-1920x1440.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC-640x480.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bellinger-River-Saw-shelled-Turtle-Myuchelys-georgesi-Photo-Credit-Darren-Fielder-CC-BY-NC.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bellinger River Snapping Turtle (<em>Myuchelys georgesi)<\/em> Photo Credit Darren Fielder CC BY NC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What role does citizen science play in this project?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizen science is at the very core of 1MT. Why? Because freshwater turtles are shy and elusive creatures. Traditional research methods often lack the necessary scope to track their populations effectively. Imagine the difference millions of eyes across the country can make! Through the user-friendly <a href=\"https:\/\/turtlesat.org.au\/turtlesat\/default.aspx\">TurtleSAT app<\/a>, citizen scientists become data collection heroes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What kind of turtle data are you interested in collecting through the TurtleSAT app?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TurtleSAT is more than just a reporting tool. Inspired by the Bellinger River crisis, the app is designed to capture a wide range of turtle data. See a healthy turtle basking on a log? Snap a picture and submit it through TurtleSAT. Witness a turtle struggling to cross a busy road? Report the location and type of road within the app. Notice unusual behaviour, like a turtle with lesions or difficulty moving? Document your observations with photos or videos and submit them through TurtleSAT. This detailed data allows researchers to identify threats, track populations, and understand the overall health of freshwater turtle populations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 1MT goes beyond mere data collection. The program is passionate about transforming participants from observers to active conservation partners. This is where the exciting turtle data comes in. Citizen scientists are trained to collect information beyond sightings. They learn nest monitoring and protection protocols, conduct standardised surveys for invasive species like foxes (think National Nest Predation Survey), and even analyse data through TurtleSAT. This fosters a sense of ownership and empowers communities to become active conservation stewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"392\" height=\"839\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Turtlesatbbb.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49477\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Turtlesatbbb.png 392w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Turtlesatbbb-140x300.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What impacts have you seen from the 1MT project so far?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of the 1MT project has been truly shell-ebrating! Winning the prestigious <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RNR4EqScorM\">Eureka Prize for Innovation in Citizen Science in 2023<\/a> served as a major validation and a springboard for further growth. The recognition brought well-deserved attention to the project&#8217;s innovative approach and its crucial role in turtle conservation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting aspect of 1MT is the collaboration with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nativetitlesa.org\/pbcs\/ngarrindjeri-aboriginal-corporation-rntbc\/\">Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal Corporation<\/a>. This partnership aims to record the rich knowledge and history of turtles held by the Ngarrindjeri people, the Traditional Owners of the land. Integrating Indigenous knowledge systems with scientific research offers invaluable insights into turtle ecology and conservation practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what exciting discoveries have emerged from the mountains of data collected so far? Well, the results are nothing short of fascinating! Citizen science data has played a key role in identifying hotspots of turtle mortality on roads. This has led to targeted signage, infrastructure improvements, and the creation of &#8220;Turtle-Safe&#8221; roads. Additionally, the data has informed conservation advice documents for numerous turtle species under the <em>EPBC Act<\/em>, a critical step towards their protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond scientific advancements, the program has fostered a positive shift in public attitudes and behaviours towards turtles. Community initiatives like Turtle Islands \u2013 safe havens built by local communities for nesting turtles \u2013 showcase the power of collective action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: How can the public get involved?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1MT project is actively seeking new citizen scientists to join the movement.

This is one of ALA\u2019s flagship programs that was designed three years ago to provide a mechanism to support the digitisation and provision of important biodiversity that may otherwise not be provided to the ALA. In the first two years the program has supported 12 remarkable teams to digitally enable their data and make it available to the ALA as open data, and through that effort internationally to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/abdmp\/\">12 current projects <\/a>span a range of\u00a0incredible institutions, species, and provide important geographic coverage. This year we are excited to have secured additional support from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/en\/about\/challenges-missions\/biosecurity\">CSIRO\u2019s Catalysing Australia\u2019s Biosecurity initiative<\/a>. This will provide additional focus on species of biosecurity concern which we know will generate additional excitement around the program, and deliver data to the ALA that assists Australia\u2019s biosecurity sector to better assess risk, and mitigations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ALA\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/09\/ALA-Strategy-2020-2025.pdf\">Strategy 2020-2025<\/a> has an action to \u2018establish data priorities to ensure Australia has a nationally comprehensive, representative and adequate biodiversity data infrastructure\u2019. In addition to supporting those parts of the biodiversity data sector that may be resource constrained, the Data Mobilisation Program has become an important mechanism for independently identifying data priorities, whether geographic or taxonomic and starting to fill these gaps in our national biodiversity data system. The existing 12 projects, and approximately nine projects we expect to fund in 2024 will play a fundamental role in ensuring the Australian biodiversity research, management and policy landscape has access to the best available data. The launch of Round 3 also provides a timely reminder that we are keen to grow this important national program through <a href=\"https:\/\/ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ALA-Australian-Biodiversity-Data-Mobilisation-Program-Prospectus-December-2022.pdf\">partnerships<\/a> with government, industry and the research sector so please do reach out if you\u2019d like to play a supporting role in future years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy our March Newsletter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the March 2024 edition of our Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) newsletter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49342"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=49342"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49342\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":49347,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/49342\/revisions\/49347"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=49342"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=49342"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=49342"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":49299,"date":"2024-03-19T08:16:43","date_gmt":"2024-03-18T21:16:43","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=49299"},"modified":"2024-03-19T13:04:56","modified_gmt":"2024-03-19T02:04:56","slug":"taxonomist-appreciation-day-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/taxonomist-appreciation-day-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Taxonomist Appreciation Day"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19<sup>th<\/sup> March is the perfect day to celebrate and share some facts about tax(onomy) in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)!  We sat down with Cam Slatyer who is a Project Manager in the ALA to chat about his extensive experience and incredible stories working across taxonomy throughout his career. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: How is taxonomy evolving in the ALA and what\u2019s your role in this project?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: The ALA has a fascinating challenge with taxonomy. We bring together data from Australia and the world, historic and new. Taxonomy is a living, evolving science where names are proposed by scientists as theories, some are accepted, and some aren\u2019t. Names change over time.&nbsp; Take the Platypus, which has the scientific name (<em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus). <\/em>When it was first described by science, it was called <em>(Platypus anatinus<\/em>), but someone discovered that the name was already being used for a group of beetles (and still is). You can\u2019t have that in taxonomy. The International Codes of Nomenclature (which definitely aren\u2019t like the Pirate Code in <em>Pirates of the Caribbean<\/em>) try to stop that sort of thing. It\u2019s like not having two people in the same friendship with the same name: they end up getting called Cam 1 and Cam 2 or Blue because one has red hair. This has meant that the poor old Platypus has a scientific name that means duck-like bird-snout&#8230; which is a pretty good description really.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the ALA, we need to cope with all names,  for everything from viruses to mountain ash to make sure that data end up under the best available name. That has been a challenge ever since the ALA first started, but now with more than 135 million records, it is vast. My job with my colleagues, is to improve it. We rely heavily on the Australian Government\u2019s Australian Biological Resources Study, who have spent the last few years putting together a National Species List, as well as the Australian Plant Census, run by all the herbaria in Australia, to get our names. We also take names from the New Zealand Organism Register and the International Catalogue of Life to make names match. So our job for the next year or so, is removing things like duplicates, adding missing names and improving name matching. One of our biggest challenges is the differences between Australia and New Zealand. It isn\u2019t just the All Blacks we need to keep an eye on! There are important scientific reasons why Australia and New Zealand have different names for the same things, but we are trying to make sure the New Zealand species have New Zealand names and the Australian species have Australian names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Platypus-Ornithorhynchus-anatinus-Photo-Credit-adamrichardt-CC-BY-NC.jpg 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Platypus (<em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus) <\/em>Photo Credit adamrichardt CC BY NC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Tell us about your experience working in taxonomy!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: I\u2019m not a taxonomist, but I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work alongside taxonomists for many years. I\u2019ve seen an amazing array of new species and been privileged enough to have three species named after me. My favourite experience was working on heritage listing mound springs, which are incredibly important and unique freshwater springs in Queensland and South Australia, having species that are often found nowhere else on Earth. I was accompanying a freshwater snail taxonomist, looking for new species and checking on existing ones. We\u2019d been through dozens of springs and hadn\u2019t found any new species, which was enormously frustrating. I was looking for frogs while my colleagues were sieving for snails (mound spring snails are tiny). I found these little black dots on some leaves and showed them to the scientist. Turns out it was the only new species of the trip, were described and then immediately identified as endangered. Not bad for a frog person!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What are some current challenges in the field of taxonomy?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Sadly, the biggest challenge is the same as when I first started working with taxonomists in the late 1990s. We are running out of taxonomists, which is frightening given they are essential for identifying threats such as the recent Varroa mite incursion, or understanding the status of threatened species. Over a third of the taxonomists in Australia are voluntary \u2013 retirees or people doing taxonomy in their spare time. Government funding for taxonomy hasn\u2019t been increased since 1974 and museums and herbaria are the mainstay of our capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Do you have a favourite species?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A: Australia has around 154,000 named species. I think I have new favourites as I learn about them. But most of my regular favourites are frogs, including the stuttering frog (<em>Mixophyes balbus<\/em>) or bats like the golden-tipped bat (<em>Phoniscus papuensis<\/em>)!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49301\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC-1920x1280.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Stuttering-Frog-Mixophyes-balbus-Photo-Credit-Daniel-CC-BY-NC.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Stuttering Frog (<em>Mixophyes balbus)<\/em> Photo Credit Daniel CC BY NC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-1920x1440.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN-640x480.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Golden-tipped-Bat-Phoniscus-papuensis-Photo-Credit-donnamarietomkinson-CC-BY-CN.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Golden-tipped Bat (<em>Phoniscus papuensis<\/em>) Photo Credit donnamarietomkinson CC BY NC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>19th March is the perfect day to celebrate and share some facts about tax(onomy) in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)!
