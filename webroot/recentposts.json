Cassowaries are the second heaviest birds in the world (after ostriches), with females reaching a maximum weight of 55kgs and males up to 76kgs! They lay bright green eggs, with dads stepping up to be in charge of incubation and chick rearing. Once the eggs hatch, baby cassowaries can walk almost immediately with their strong back legs. Babies are not born with their signature black plumage, instead have banded yellow and brown striped patterning as chicks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"967\" height=\"649\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48811\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC.jpg 967w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Southern-Cassowary-Casuarius-casuarius-Photo-Credit-DHFischer-CC-BY-NC-768x515.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Southern Cassowary (<em>Casuarius casuarius<\/em>) chick.

Cassowaries are notorious for communicating through deep rumbles, hisses and grunting sounds. Cassowaries use various vocalisations to communicate through their dense rainforest habitats. If you hear a cassowary calling, make sure you keep your distance. Equipped with a razor-sharp beak, talons and a particularly territorial nature, cassowaries are more than capable of tearing through flesh if they feel threatened. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keystone species<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cassowaries are \u2018keystone species\u2019 &#8211; species which has a disproportionately important role in their natural ecosystems. In rainforest habitats across northern QLD, cassowaries play a critical role in dispersing many native seeds through fragmented rainforest landscapes. Due to their large size, cassowaries can swallow fruits and other plants whole, digest the pulp and excrete seeds intact in dung piles (aka natural fertilisers). This ability to disperse large seeds helps to maintain healthy ecosystems by promoting vegetation regeneration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better illustrate how cassowaries support native plant dispersal across rainforest ecosystems, Callum and Shandiya from the ALA Science and Decision Support team have created an interactive map. The map shows 15 native plant species across the QLD wet tropics against cassowary records in the ALA!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\">Check out the interactive map!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cjwaite23.shinyapps.io\/cassowary_app\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"534\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1024x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48855\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1024x534.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-300x156.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-768x400.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1536x801.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-2048x1068.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Cassowary-day-1920x1001.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about native seeds in tropical areas, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ath.org.au\/\">Australian Topical Herbarium<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>#WorldCassowaryDay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Celebrating #WorldCassowaryDay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":48857,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48809"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48856,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48809\/revisions\/48856"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/48857"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48809"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48809"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48809"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":48740,"date":"2023-08-25T10:42:56","date_gmt":"2023-08-25T00:42:56","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=48740"},"modified":"2023-08-25T10:42:56","modified_gmt":"2023-08-25T00:42:56","slug":"ala-national-science-week-2023-recordings","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/ala-national-science-week-2023-recordings\/","title":{"rendered":"ALA National Science Week 2023 recordings"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate National Science Week 2023, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) hosted three free virtual events.

Tuttle CC BY NC&nbsp;<\/em>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the difficulty of accessing restricted data on species has created barriers for research, environmental <a>assessmen<\/a>t and conservation. Data on species has been modified, withheld or shared based on inconsistent organisational polices. The <a>National Framework <\/a>is the first of its kind, jointly developed by the Atlas of Living Australia, the Australian Research Data Commons, all the government environmental agencies in Australia, herbaria, fauna collections, EcoCommons Australia and the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing the precise locations of restricted<a> access <\/a>species potentially risks disturbance, harm or exploitation. Therefore, access to some species information is limited, accessible only to data custodians and approved data users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Framework outlines the principles to guide data custodians and users in the sharing of restricted access species data responsibly and appropriately. By adopting a nationally consistent evidence-based approach to managing restricted access species data, the National Framework aim to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>promote responsible data-sharing practices<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>give data custodians the confidence to safely share restricted access species data<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>assist data custodians to maintain the consistency and quality of data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cBirdLife Australia has long upheld a restricted access policy for sensitive species data as a basis for our citizen science work. This gives contributors the confidence that sharing their data will not put species at risk, while still allowing for its use in conservation. We are excited to now have a nationally consistent framework for sensitive species data sharing, which will massively increase the use and impact of bird and other species data in science and conservation\u201d said<\/em> Dr Golo Maurer, BirdLife Citizen Science Program Leader.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Restricted Access Species Data Service (RASDS) for Australia<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new RASDS allows researchers and other trusted data users to request restricted access species data from all participating data custodians in Australia via a central point. &nbsp;The service allows data custodians a way of managing and storing request workflows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cRASDS seeks to remove a major barrier to the flow of species data by standardising the way we describe and exchange sensitive species data<\/em>\u201d said Ron Avery, STL Biodiversity Information Systems Science, Economics and Insight Division, NSW Dept&nbsp;of Planning and Environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Partners:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These products were developed as part of a collaborative project between the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/#tab_pane-C\">Atlas of Living Australia<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/ardc.edu.au\">Australian Research Data Commons<\/a> (ARDC), the Australian Government, state and territory governments, conservation agencies, museums, and herbaria, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecocommons.org.au\/\">EcoCommons<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/wabsi.org.au\/\">Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more, visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rasd.org.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RASD webpage<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Launching the National Framework for the Sharing of Restricted Access Species Data and the Restricted Access Species Data Service for Australia<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4596,"featured_media":48569,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[170,11],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48408"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4596"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=48408"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48408\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":48571,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/48408\/revisions\/48571"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/48569"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=48408"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=48408"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=48408"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
