However, getting data directly into your own custom analysis program &#8211; a valuable tool for researchers &#8211; previously hasn\u2019t been as straightforward. To bridge this gap, Matilda Stevenson, Martin Westgate, Dax Kellie and Peggy Newman created an ALA software package in the R programming language called {<a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/\">galah<\/a>}.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>{galah} has been designed to be an easy-to-access tool that helps coders, researchers, decision-makers, and citizen scientists better understand and visualise data in the ALA. For example, the <a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-030-88800-8_48-1\">first publication citing {galah}<\/a> was just released, outlining the important need for conservation of marsupials in the north-eastern tropics of Australia. Some notable studies of {galah}\u2019s previous iteration {ALA4R} include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/wr\/WR20070\">tracking the seasonal movement and impact of invasive buffalo across northern Australia<\/a>, estimating the total (and undiscovered) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/full\/10.1073\/pnas.2115329119\">number of trees on Earth<\/a>, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/researchsystem.canberra.edu.au\/ws\/portalfiles\/portal\/62608058\/Hemming_Kyle.pdf\">analysing native and exotic grass groups<\/a> with different carbon storing capacities (C3\/C4) and their relationship with varying environmental gradients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension of {galah} into <a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\">Python<\/a> expands the usability of the tool to allow users to retrieve data in a platform that they may be more familiar with. In 2023, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/meet-caitlin-an-ala-indigenous-internship-student-with-a-flare-for-coding\/\">Caitlin Ramsay<\/a> &#8211; an ALA Indigenous Internship student &#8211; was the first to use the Python extension of {galah} to <a href=\"https:\/\/labs.ala.org.au\/posts\/2023-04-28_plotting-invasive-species\/post.html\">understand the expansion of invasive species, both native and introduced, into Australia<\/a>. Such work could even be extended to other countries as the Python version of {galah} hosts, not only the Australian, but also the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sibbr.gov.br\/\">Brazilian<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gbif.es\/\">Spanish<\/a> living atlases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/galah.ala.org.au\/Python\/\">access Galah 0.1.0 (Python) here<\/a>.

Why is the field of taxonomy so important to the ALA\u2019s work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taxonomy provides the mechanism to identify and classify organisms. It\u2019s vital to the ALA because the name of the species observed is one of the three core pieces of information (with location and date) that is required to create a species occurrence record. It\u2019s estimated that only about a third of the +700,000 species found in Australia have been given a scientific name.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aggregating species data is reliant on the records being accurately identified at the lowest resolution of the taxonomic hierarchy possible. Identifying organisms in a particular place is important to making decisions about natural resource management and understanding changing climates.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taxonomy provides a way to both get data into the ALA and to search for data. All incoming data points are matched to the \u2018taxonomic backbone\u2019 or placed into the classification hierarchy in the ALA infrastructure.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It\u2019s important to be aware that taxonomic names are not static and are continually being revised. This is because researchers learn more (through techniques such as genetic analysis) to better understand how to delineate species. The ALA is on a constant journey to update our taxonomic backbone, to ensure our structure is as current and accurate as possible.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Tell us about taxonomy in your career?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I wouldn\u2019t call myself a taxonomist, both my honours and PhD projects were in zoophysiology rather than taxonomy, but I have been around taxonomy since I started working at Museums Victoria after my PhD in 1995. Earlier than that, I\u2019ve had an interest in collecting biological things since I was a child. I would collect shells at the beach, sorting, identifying, and labelling them. Even as a nine-year-old, I would pack a bag full of books alongside my beach towel, so that I could identify my finds. I had a logbook for recording what I collected each year, so I guess that\u2019s where it started!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I think that for many people, wanting to know what an animal or plant is called is their first interaction with taxonomy \u2013 even if they wouldn\u2019t put it that way. At Museums Victoria, I led a fantastic team to develop&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/museumsvictoria.com.au\/apps\/national-field-guide-apps\/\"><em>The National Field Guide<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;apps project.

At last year\u2019s GBIF Governing Board meeting in Brussels, the ALA and our biological collections partners in CSIRO successfully bid to host the 2023 meeting of the Governing Board in Australia. The meeting will follow directly from the TDWG event and will be hosted in Canberra in mid-October.
