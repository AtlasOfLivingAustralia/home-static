My goal is to bring high-quality plant pathology research down to the south-west biodiversity hotspot in Western Australia, with a focus on investigating disease resistance gene diversity in WA\u2019s endemic plant species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Platforms like the ALA will assist ahead of fieldwork for collections, and will also enable the collection of data on plants and pathogens during this type of research. It will be incredibly beneficial in a biodiversity hotspot which is threatened by plant pathogens like<em> Phytophthora cinnamomi<\/em>, which has already had a large impact in that region.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/ALA-Variable-Bossiaea.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50796\" style=\"width:235px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/ALA-Variable-Bossiaea.jpg 576w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/09\/ALA-Variable-Bossiaea-169x300.jpg 169w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Variable Bossiaea (<em>Bossiaea heterophylla<\/em>).
