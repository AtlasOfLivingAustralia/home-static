It is a cryptic bird and difficult to observe, but research has revealed very high numbers of snipe in some Victorian urban wetlands. Through the online tool developed through this project, wetlands important to support Latham\u2019s Snipe are identified and annual numbers recorded at these wetlands are included in wetland report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Impacts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Raise awareness of urban wetlands:<\/strong> The project has created a publicly accessible online system that highlights the importance of urban wetlands for biodiversity conservation. This can raise awareness among policymakers, planners, and the general public to give greater consideration to urban wetlands are resources of high biodiversity value.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved decision-making:<\/strong> By providing quantitative data on the value of urban wetlands, the project can inform better decision-making related to land use and development. This ultimately is aimed to lead to better protection of these crucial habitats.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Standardised metrics<\/strong>: The project has developed a standardised metrics based on citizen-science data for assessing urban wetland value. These metrics can facilitate comparisons across different wetlands and regions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Citizen science integration: <\/strong>The project incorporates data from citizen science initiatives like the ALA, Birdlife Australia and eBird. This can empower citizen scientists and contribute valuable data for conservation efforts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved monitoring of key bird species:<\/strong> Using the Latham&#8217;s Snipe as a case study, this project demonstrates the potential for improving understanding of declining species&#8217; distribution and habitat use in urban areas.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201dWetlands in urban areas are often overlooked in protection efforts due to a misconception that they are weedy, littered swamps that have low conservation value. However, they provide important refuge habitat for a range of species in our cities, including the Vulnerable Latham\u2019s Snipe. We developed this tool to help raise awareness of the biodiversity value of small urban wetlands by presenting snapshots of data recorded by citizen scientists,<\/em>\u201d said Dr Birgita Hansen, Project Lead and Senior Research Fellow at Federation University. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the online tool <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuingurbanwetlands.org.au\/\">here<\/a>.

Why? Because freshwater turtles are shy and elusive creatures. Traditional research methods often lack the necessary scope to track their populations effectively. Imagine the difference millions of eyes across the country can make! Through the user-friendly <a href=\"https:\/\/turtlesat.org.au\/turtlesat\/default.aspx\">TurtleSAT app<\/a>, citizen scientists become data collection heroes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What kind of turtle data are you interested in collecting through the TurtleSAT app?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TurtleSAT is more than just a reporting tool. Inspired by the Bellinger River crisis, the app is designed to capture a wide range of turtle data. See a healthy turtle basking on a log? Snap a picture and submit it through TurtleSAT. Witness a turtle struggling to cross a busy road? Report the location and type of road within the app. Notice unusual behaviour, like a turtle with lesions or difficulty moving? Document your observations with photos or videos and submit them through TurtleSAT. This detailed data allows researchers to identify threats, track populations, and understand the overall health of freshwater turtle populations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 1MT goes beyond mere data collection. The program is passionate about transforming participants from observers to active conservation partners. This is where the exciting turtle data comes in. Citizen scientists are trained to collect information beyond sightings. They learn nest monitoring and protection protocols, conduct standardised surveys for invasive species like foxes (think National Nest Predation Survey), and even analyse data through TurtleSAT. This fosters a sense of ownership and empowers communities to become active conservation stewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"392\" height=\"839\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Turtlesatbbb.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49477\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Turtlesatbbb.png 392w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Turtlesatbbb-140x300.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What impacts have you seen from the 1MT project so far?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of the 1MT project has been truly shell-ebrating! Winning the prestigious <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RNR4EqScorM\">Eureka Prize for Innovation in Citizen Science in 2023<\/a> served as a major validation and a springboard for further growth. The recognition brought well-deserved attention to the project&#8217;s innovative approach and its crucial role in turtle conservation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting aspect of 1MT is the collaboration with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nativetitlesa.org\/pbcs\/ngarrindjeri-aboriginal-corporation-rntbc\/\">Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal Corporation<\/a>. This partnership aims to record the rich knowledge and history of turtles held by the Ngarrindjeri people, the Traditional Owners of the land. Integrating Indigenous knowledge systems with scientific research offers invaluable insights into turtle ecology and conservation practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what exciting discoveries have emerged from the mountains of data collected so far? Well, the results are nothing short of fascinating! Citizen science data has played a key role in identifying hotspots of turtle mortality on roads. This has led to targeted signage, infrastructure improvements, and the creation of &#8220;Turtle-Safe&#8221; roads. Additionally, the data has informed conservation advice documents for numerous turtle species under the <em>EPBC Act<\/em>, a critical step towards their protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond scientific advancements, the program has fostered a positive shift in public attitudes and behaviours towards turtles. Community initiatives like Turtle Islands \u2013 safe havens built by local communities for nesting turtles \u2013 showcase the power of collective action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: How can the public get involved?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1MT project is actively seeking new citizen scientists to join the movement. How can you get involved? Download the <a href=\"https:\/\/turtlesat.org.au\/turtlesat\/default.aspx\">TurtleSAT app<\/a>, report your turtle sightings, and participate in data collection efforts. You can also spread awareness about the project, support fundraising initiatives, or even explore volunteering opportunities with local turtle conservation groups.
