Noongar-Wudjari is in the south-west corner of Western Australia. Working specifically with Wudjari knowledge holders \u2013 Lynette Knapp and Gail Yorkshire \u2013 this project involves recording ancestral language and knowledge about plants and animals, to preserve and share. Knowledge and language records for over 90 plants and animals have been collected and are now ready for publication through the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What made you pursue this kind of work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a map maker. I fell in love with the ALA when I started using the spatial portal to show the relationships between plants, animals and place. I was constantly calling the ALA to ask to show it off at schools and workshops \u2013 finally they reneged and based on my extensive work with Aboriginal communities in the Kimberley and fire mapping, offered me the position to lead the IEK. I feel incredibly honoured to be doing this work, with the amazing people I work with in community and the ALA, and to be sharing this knowledge that helps bridge the gap between traditional and western science and ultimately improves our management of our land and sea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screen-Shot-2021-11-12-at-4.50.18-pm.png\" alt=\"Baardi (genus Endoxyla) from an Acacia tree\" class=\"wp-image-45623\" width=\"756\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screen-Shot-2021-11-12-at-4.50.18-pm.png 505w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screen-Shot-2021-11-12-at-4.50.18-pm-300x210.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px\" \/><figcaption>Baardi (genus <em>Endoxyla<\/em>) from an Acacia tree.

The aim of the IEK program is to promote Indigenous ecological knowledge in the ALA. I am doing this by working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to include their language and knowledge in the ALA where it directly links to the Western science knowledge for plants and animals. While I lead the IEK program within the ALA each project with each community is co-led and co-designed with our Partner Researchers &#8211; people and organisations who are working directly with communities to collect, store and protect Indigenous language and ecological knowledge about plants and animals. My role is to facilitate the flow of knowledge into the ALA from our Partner Researchers and work with the ALA to ensure the communities goals and aspirations around sharing their language and knowledge are being met.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there something in particular at the ESA conference you\u2019re looking forward to this year?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am excited to share this work with ecologists and environmental scientists from around Australia as an integral step in accessing all the knowledge we need to look after our environment.
