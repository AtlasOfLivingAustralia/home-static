The workplan acts as both an internal planning tool to guide team priorities, and for external communication purposes to provide our stakeholders with greater visibility into ALA operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2024-25 will be the fifth year of delivery under the ALA\u2019s current strategy. Priorities will include the production release of several important initiatives that commenced 2023-24, including the (a) operational national biosecurity alerts service, (b) new ALA home page, species pages and global search interface under the UX\/UI project, and (c) stage two of the taxonomic architecture project which will include improved species names matching. Collectively, these capabilities will be transformational for Australia\u2019s biodiversity data community, and we look forward to their release. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a national research infrastructure supported under the NCRIS program, partnerships are fundamental to how the ALA benefits Australia\u2019s researchers, decision-makers and community. In 2024-25, the ALA will further partner with Australia\u2019s biological collections sector and to develop a case to support a <a href=\"https:\/\/ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Accelerating_Discovery_and_Access_to_Australias_Biological_Collections_2024_June.pdf\">national approach to biological collections<\/a> akin to the major programs currently underway in Europe and the United States. Beyond the biological collections sector, the ALA will improve the reach and depth of its partnerships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, working more closely with Indigenous ranger programs to co-design and deliver training programs to enhance the utility of the ALA. Similarly, this year we established a number of partnerships with the environmental consulting sector given the critical role they play in assessing and monitoring Australia\u2019s biodiversity, and we plan to extend these partnerships to support improved translation of research infrastructure to industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our workplan also identifies project leads from the ALA, and we encourage you to reach out to our team to learn more or to collaborate.
