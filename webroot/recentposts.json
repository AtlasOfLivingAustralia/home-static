in which we launch the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/the-ala-australian-biodiversity-data-mobilisation-program\/\">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new program will provide grants to institutions to mobilise their data to the ALA. This could include the transcription of historical field sheets, acquisition of contemporary digital scanning technology, or even the development or purchase of software to provide better approaches to biodiversity data management and delivery. The \u2018how\u2019 will be up to the successful grant recipients, hence the program will offer maximum flexibility for successful applicants. We plan to award 6 grants in the first year of the program across both small ($20K) and large grants ($50K).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"why-were-creating-this-grant-program\">Why we&#8217;re creating this grant program<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of the ALA as Australia\u2019s biodiversity data infrastructure rests so much on the contribution made by its data partners across multiple domains. Data in the ALA comes from biological collections, museum and herbaria, state government, major research programs, non-government organisations and increasingly citizen scientists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We partner with over 900 of these groups and individuals to harmonise Australia\u2019s biodiversity data. Despite these partner contributions we remain acutely aware that for small institutions, or where historical data remains in analogue format, providing biodiversity data to the ALA remains a challenge, and we encourage you to apply for assistance through this new program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been reflecting on the ecological data I collected as a researcher working across the south west slopes of NSW and parts of Victoria some years ago. I spent a decade supporting the collection of fundamental data about Australia\u2019s flora and fauna. Much of this made its way into digital databases, at the time in CSIRO and the University of Melbourne. However, the ALA did not exist so this record although digital, remains undiscoverable.&nbsp; I also saw first-hand the filing cabinets of paper field sheets from my predecessors that provide a fundamental record of our biodiversity and may never be digitised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this context in mind, I am &nbsp;very excited to be launching the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/the-ala-australian-biodiversity-data-mobilisation-program\/\">ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"program-details-application-and-assessment\">Program details: application and assessment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly there\u2019s a massive amount of biodiversity data that remains un-digitised and the job of the evaluation panel will be to make informed assessments against defined criteria. Detailed guidelines will be published shortly on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blog\/\">ALA blog<\/a> and on our ALA social media channels &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/atlaslivingaust\">Twitter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/atlasoflivingaustralia\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/1232460\">LinkedIn<\/a>. Principles underpinning the program include alignment with national priorities and a focus on significant historical biodiversity information not currently available as FAIR data \u2013 findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program will be\u00a0evaluated by an independent panel Chaired by Dr David Cantrill, one of the ALA Advisory Board\u2019s longest serving members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team is so excited by the opportunity this program will deliver Australia\u2019s biodiversity community and already anticipates the legacy it will deliver. We look forward to seeing some fantastic applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy our March 2022 newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Andre Zerger <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Launch of the ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program Welcome to the March 2022 edition of our newsletter, in which we launch the ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program.

FAIR data \u2013 findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable &#8211; can be shared with other researchers and people working in biodiversity policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High quality and accessible biodiversity data helps conservation efforts and informs decision-making and solutions for environmental challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"funding-to-support-your-digitisation-efforts\"><strong>Funding to support your digitisation efforts<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that organising, standardising, and digitising data takes time and effort. The ALA Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program is here to help. The grant program will award small (up to $20k) and large (up to $50k) grants to biodiversity data owners to support purchasing equipment (e.g. camera, scanner) or employing staff in order to mobilise data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applications for the 2022 round of the program have now closed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"who-can-apply\"><strong>Who can apply?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re looking for institutions or biodiversity researchers who need help digitising historic physical records and mobilising data into the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no catch, as long as the records are biodiversity-related. This can be for any wild species in Australia \u2013 from koalas to cane toads, eucalypts to bioluminescent fungi, we want to know about it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data might be in paper field notes, or species in physical collections. Whatever it is, we\u2019ll be giving out grants to 6 institutions through both small ($20K) and large grants($50k).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering why! Well, available data = useful data \u2013 so by making historical data accessible, it can be shared more widely and used by researchers to support biodiversity conservation efforts and decision-making.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-1024x576.png\" alt=\"colourful specimens in an insect collection\" class=\"wp-image-46503\" width=\"1005\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2022\/02\/5.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1005px) 100vw, 1005px\" \/><figcaption><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Image: Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC)<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"details-of-the-program\"><strong>Details of the program<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-apply\">How to apply<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All applications must be sent using the program submission form. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"closing-date-for-applications\">Closing date for applications<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Applications for 2022 have now closed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-much-funding-can-i-apply-for\">How much funding can I apply for? <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two funding amounts on offer, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>small grants up to $20,000<\/li><li>large grants up to $50,000<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"who-can-apply\">Who can apply?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This grant program is open to individuals or groups within an institution, excluding existing partners who already receive ALA or National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy support. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-data-are-suitable-for-the-grant\">What data are suitable for the grant?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul id=\"block-72757bf6-1e52-42ba-81ff-c1d26286af64\"><li>The program will target existing data.
