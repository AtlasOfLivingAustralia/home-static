Species taxonomy is continuously evolving based on new scientific discoveries (new species being described), as well as techniques such as genetic sequencing, bioinformatics and advanced imaging which can change the way researchers understand existing species leading to re-classification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To accurately reflect current taxonomy of species listed within the ALA, we are continuously working to improve our \u2018taxonomic backbone\u2019 i.e. source material for which species in the ALA are structured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How species are structured in the ALA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.ala.org.au\/support\/solutions\/articles\/6000261677-taxonomy-in-the-ala\">taxonomic backbone<\/a>\u00a0is principally sourced from the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/biodiversity.org.au\/nsl\/\">National Species List (NSL)<\/a>, but we also draw names from the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nzor.org.nz\/\">New Zealand Organism Register (NZOR)<\/a>\u00a0as well as the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.catalogueoflife.org\/\">Catalogue of Life (CoL)<\/a>. We have recently undergone significant changes to align our taxonomic backbone to better fit current scientific names recognised in Australia. This reduces duplication of species listings in the ALA and improves accuracy and navigation when users are searching for new species or threatened species records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the numbers?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2023, the ALA had 154,506 species of animals (with 2,400 unranked animal species listings) and 48,972 species of plants (with 5,555 unranked plant species listings), giving a total of ~ 211,000 plant and animal species recorded in the ALA. Unranked species are species that either cannot be placed in the taxonomy or have been added to enable data matching to an existing species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through our recent work to improve ALA\u2019s taxonomic backbone removing duplication and aligning to current taxonomy, we have reduced these listings to 124,999 animal species (with 11 unranked) and 41,740 plant species (with 37 unranked). Whilst improving ALA\u2019s taxonomy is an evolving process, this represents a major removal of duplication and error fixing in the ALA\u2019s species listings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do these changes look like in the ALA?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though much of the work to refresh the ALA taxonomic backbone is in the back-end, here are some visible changes that you may notice across the ALA:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improving synonym matching<\/strong> \u2013 With thousands of unique species in Australia, and more being described and named every year, many species are known by more than one name. While the ALA uses the NSL to source synonyms for species (different names referring to the same speices), there are still differences in names, particularly those used internationally. For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bie.ala.org.au\/species\/https:\/biodiversity.org.au\/afd\/taxa\/06df777d-8177-4c18-984e-7fa4c5c846ca\">Green Tree Frog (<em>Litoria caerulea<\/em>)<\/a>&nbsp;is known internationally as (<em>Ranoidea careulea)<\/em>&nbsp;in data sets such as iNaturalist. The changed taxonomy will now mean that many of these synonyms will match to the scientific name that species are most commonly known by in Australia.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Placing names in the taxonomic hierarchy<\/strong> \u2013 The ALA places species within a taxonomy tree, like a family tree. The taxonomic backbone refresh means that we have resolved many previous errors and repeat entries for invertebrates, vertebrates and vascular plants.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Correcting species entries<\/strong> \u2013 We have taken steps to remove duplications and unresolved synonyms in the ALA by reducing the number of sources for our taxonomic backbone. We have therefore removed the Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota (CAAB) and the NZOR as a source of names for vertebrates and invertebrates. We have also consolidated all minor sources into four edited lists that add names used in legislation or species management that do not occur in the NSL \u2013 these include a conservation list, a migratory species list, a pests and weeds list and a biosecurity invasive list (species not found in Australia).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"737\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala-1024x737.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala-1024x737.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala-300x216.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala-768x552.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Taxonomy-ala.jpg 1297w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Example of classifying species in a hierarchy on the ALA.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will continue to further improve the ALA taxonomic backbone over the next twelve to eighteen months and resolve issues that have not already addressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are continuing to provide both NSL and NZOR names for plant species, at the request of the <a href=\"https:\/\/chah.gov.au\/\">Council of Australasian Herbaria<\/a>.&nbsp; There will continue to be some duplication both in the taxonomic tree and in scientific name synonyms between Australia and New Zealand.

Home to more than 132 million species occurrence records of native and introduced species, the ALA is often the first platform where invasive species incursions are publicly recorded. Invasive species \u2013 like pests, weeds, and diseases \u2013 are a major driver of biodiversity loss and pose significant threats to both the economy and our community. To ensure management authorities are notified of new incursions, the ALA has partnered with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agriculture.gov.au\/\">Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/\">CSIRO<\/a> through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/en\/about\/challenges-missions\/biosecurity\">Catalysing Australia\u2019s Biosecurity<\/a> initiative to develop the Biosecurity Alerts Service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA\u2019s Biosecurity Alerts Service provides weekly email notifications of occurrences of invasive species to management authorities. These occurrences are aggregated from more than 850 data suppliers, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inaturalist.org\/\">iNaturalist<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feralscan.org.au\/\">FeralScan<\/a>. The Biosecurity Alerts Service reports the species name, observation location, images, data provider and provides direct links to the ALA occurrence record. Up until the end of 2023, 1,441 occurrences of invasive species had triggered a biosecurity alert, which included reports of highly invasive species, such as red imported fire ants (<em>Solenopsis invicta)<\/em>, Asian sho<a>re crabs (<em>Hemigrapsus sanguineus<\/em>), m<\/a>yrtle rust and <em>Opuntia <\/em>cacti.

While we have only been using it for a short period we have already recorded several significant detections. I\u2019ve been promoting the system at every opportunity,\u201d said Steve Csurhes, Biosecurity Queensland, Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the ALA has developed new <a>spatial filtering features <\/a>within the Biosecurity Alerts Service. This has allowed users to limit alerts to within state\/territory or local government boundaries (including marine boundaries) or provide a custom spatial boundary (shapefile) for alerts within a user-defined area. This has improved the utility of biosecurity alerts, allowing them to be used more readily for reporting within National Parks boundaries or outside of biosecurity containment zones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA is currently delivering Phase 1 of the Biosecurity Alert Service, which includes roll out of the Service to Commonwealth, State and Territory biosecurity managers. Phase 2 will begin in mid-2024 with operational enhancements allowing the service to scale nationally better, and the inclusion of interested local government areas, natural resource managers, non-government organisations and others within the biosecurity sector.

Repeated infections can reduce plant vigour, cause significant defoliation, killing more susceptible trees and preventing flowering and fruiting on others, thereby interfering with reproduction and reducing the food resources for many native animals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"786\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-786x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49196\" style=\"width:446px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-786x1024.jpg 786w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-230x300.jpg 230w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-768x1000.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5-1179x1536.jpg 1179w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Austromyrtus-dulcis-fruit5.jpg 1448w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Myrtle rust on <a>Midgen berr<\/a>ies (<em>Austromyrtus dulcis)<\/em> &#8211; Photo Credit Geoff Pegg, Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"628\" height=\"942\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Geoff-Pgg.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49197\" style=\"width:446px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Geoff-Pgg.jpg 628w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Geoff-Pgg-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Repeated myrtle rust infection has almost killed this 100-year-old Sour cherry tree (<em>Syzygium corynanthum<\/em>) in the Tallebudgera Valley <a>&#8211; Photo Credit Geoff Pegg<\/a>, Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Help provide up-to-date myrtle rust data<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To combat the threat of myrtle rust, current data is required to inform researchers, policymakers, landholders and decision-makers about how myrtle rust spreads&nbsp;and impacts different plant communities. Members of the public across Australia can play a vital role by reporting possible myrtle rust infections through citizen science, providing data that helps to protect Australia\u2019s high-risk species. Data from citizen science contributes to a more complete record of the abundance and impacts of invasive species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alyssa Martino, a PhD student at the University of Sydney who is studying myrtle rust infection and leads the iNaturalist Gum Tree Guardians project says that,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cPeople submit myrtle rust reports from their gardens or out in the bush \u2013 places that are hard for professional researchers to monitor. When people report these myrtle rust sightings, we get a broader understanding of the extent of the disease which gives us a chance to fight back against the spread.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The myrtle rust data from citizen scientists are then aggregated in the ALA with data collected from other sources, such as professional scientists, industry and government agencies, to be open and accessible data points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to report myrtle rust sightings<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By collecting myrtle rust data, you\u2019re helping
