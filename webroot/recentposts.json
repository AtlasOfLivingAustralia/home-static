That\u2019s not a bad thing &#8211; recent research found that, compared to iNaturalist, eBird&nbsp;is less biased towards larger, more detectable bird species&nbsp;thanks to their use of a&nbsp;semi-structured data format.&nbsp;Thanks for all your hard work eBird users!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/donald_hobern.webp\" alt=\"Donald Hobern\" class=\"wp-image-45695\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/donald_hobern.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/11\/donald_hobern-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"donald-hobern-ala\"><strong>Donald Hobern<\/strong> (ALA)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ecoassets-research-data-for-environmental-indicators\"><strong>EcoAssets: Research data for environmental indicators<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Presenting on Tuesday, 23 November 2021. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is all about trying to make it easier for anyone (researchers, citizen scientists, policy-makers, etc.) to find quality data on biodiversity in ways that make their lives easier, help them to answer the questions they care about, and contribute to a more sustainable world.
