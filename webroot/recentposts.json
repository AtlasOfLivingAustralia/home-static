Government biosecurity efforts aim to prevent, respond to and assist recovery from pests and diseases, with particular focus on the invasive species that threaten our environment and the economy. Early detection of exotic and introduced pest species is crucial to managing and eradicating invasive pests. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EBO is charged with protecting Australia\u2019s native flora, fauna and associated social amenity from the damaging effects of exotic pests, weeds and diseases that come  from overseas. One of their biggest challenges is knowing when pests and diseases first come into Australia and keeping track of their spread across the country. International border controls and quarantine measures are crucial elements for biosecurity control, but pests, weeds and diseases can still elude these controls. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) harnesses innovative solutions to complement existing methods of detection to further bolster biosecurity incursion surveillance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For over ten years, the ALA \u2013 our national biodiversity data infrastructure \u2013 has been aggregating occurrence records of plant, animals and fungi species from over 700 data partners. In 2020, the ALA worked closely with DAWE to establish automatic alerts for targeted species on the National Priority List of Exotic Environmental Pests, Weeds and Diseases that are considered the greatest biosecurity risks to Australia. Using this list, the ALA set up an alert system. Now, when observations of those target species are uploaded to the database, an alert is sent to the EBO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ala-alert-provides-extra-layer-of-defence\">ALA alert provides extra layer of defence<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44698\" width=\"408\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--1920x1440.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer--640x480.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Asian-Shore-Crab-iNaturalist_USA_image-by-Chris-Alice-Kratzer-.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" \/><figcaption>The Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) is considered a biosecurity threat to Australia, and was detected in Victoria in 2020.

In early 2020, a suspected sighting of the Asian shore crab by a member of the public on Port Phillip Bay in Victoria. This sighting was uploaded as a report into the ALA and provided the earliest available alert of the incursions. Early awareness of incursions into Australia by exotic species such as the Asian shore crab provide the best scenario for implementing successful management and eradication programs. If left unchecked exotic species can spread rapidly and compete with our native flora and fauna. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode demonstrated that the ALA notification system can provide over 9 months earlier warning of an incursion. Another example of the benefits of the ALA notification system, involving an exotic wasp, demonstrated that an incursion could be found 24-36 months earlier than the current reporting system. The notification system can also include a facility to validate and amend reports, which can be important for clarifying Australia\u2019s pest status. Citizen science apps such as iNaturalist Australia, among many others, feed data into the ALA and directly contribute to the national biosecurity surveillance system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <em>\u201cThe ALA alert system is simple and is proving to be an important asset to our operational capability,\u201d <\/em>said Andrew Pearce, from DAWE\u2019s Environmental Biosecurity Office<em>. <\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cThis is a layer of defence we haven\u2019t had before and it has excellent potential for further development and expansion to deliver a low cost biosecurity surveillance and monitoring capability<\/em>.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The national biosecurity alert system is an excellent example of how the ALA is able to provide trusted biodiversity data to support environmental biosecurity program managers and help deliver better outcomes for Australian ecosystems and environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/\">ala.org.au <\/a>or contact<a href=\"mailto:support@ala.org.au\"> support@ala.org.au<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/21280-ALA-Case-Study-Fact-Sheets-Biosecurity-V3-lowres.pdf\">View or print this impact story as a PDF<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Atlas of Living Australia and its large network of biodiversity data providers are helping our national<br \/>\nEnvironmental Biosecurity Office  (EBO) in the Department of  Agriculture, Water and the  Environment (DAWE) to protect  Australia\u2019s flora and fauna from  exotic biosecurity threats. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44698,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[170,11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44697"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44697"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44697\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44715,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44697\/revisions\/44715"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44698"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44697"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44697"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44697"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":44702,"date":"2021-05-24T15:59:15","date_gmt":"2021-05-24T05:59:15","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=44702"},"modified":"2021-05-24T16:03:49","modified_gmt":"2021-05-24T06:03:49","slug":"welcome-prof-stephen-van-leeuwen-to-our-ala-advisory-board","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/welcome-prof-stephen-van-leeuwen-to-our-ala-advisory-board\/","title":{"rendered":"Welcome Prof Stephen van Leeuwen to our ALA Advisory Board"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44704\" width=\"380\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-768x548.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1536x1096.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res-1920x1370.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SvL-WestPix_low-res.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Prof Stephen van Leeuwen is a respected South West Boojarah Wardandi Noongar whose Country is in the Busselton &#8211; Margaret River area of south west Western Australia.&nbsp; He is a Botanical Ecologist, with a diverse research pedigree extending from threatened flora survey, fire ecology and threatened flora and fauna management through to biological survey, arid zone ecology, plant taxonomy and pollination biology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Botanical Ecologist Stephen has had a long career working with biological data, from early work experience projects at the WA Herbarium, to being involved in the foundational WA Orchid Atlas and Banksia Atlas projects. He has also undertaken and managed botanical and biological surveys across the Pilbara, Gascoyne and neighbouring Western Deserts including fulfilling a leadership role in the Pilbara Biological Survey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to leaving the WA Public Service, Stephen was Assistant Director of Science in the Biodiversity and Conservation portfolio at the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, overseeing operations of the WA Herbarium and of the Western Australian biodiversity data portal &#8211; NatureMap. He also collaborated with the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute (WABSI) to establish the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/newsletter\/ala-helps-improve-environmental-impact-assessments-in-western-australia\/\">Index of Biodiversity Surveys for Assessments<\/a> (IBSA) program and was also the WA champion for the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network\u2019s (TERN) Surveillance (formerly AusPlots and Australian Transect Network) program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Building cultural competency and engagement with Indigenous Australians<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent chat, Stephen shared with us his vision for his role with the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very keen to guide the ALA as it builds capacity and capabilities to be a culturally safe organisation that can respectfully capture, curate and support Traditional knowledge (including language) and all it entails while ensuring the sovereignty of this knowledge, Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights and the mutual sharing of benefit derived from such knowledge,\u201d Stephen said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI hope to build the Board\u2019s cultural competency and engagement with Indigenous Australians to address the needs and aspirations of Indigenous Australians.&nbsp; In part I\u2019ll do this by unlocking opportunities within my networks across Indigenous, academic, government and corporate sectors to build collaborations and minimise duplication of effort with respect to the participation and engagement of Indigenous Australians in the operations and activities of ALA.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Making a mark: some key priorities for his tenure with the ALA<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a pragmatic on-ground perspective Stephen would like to see ALA\u2019s activities continue to grow and service the needs of Indigenous land and sea Country managers and ranger teams, particularly in respect to the development of tools and applications that enable greater Traditional Knowledge capture, a reduction in the duplication of effort, and a greater emphasis on how Traditional Knowledge can help provide solutions to biodiversity conservation and land management challenges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While on the ALA Board, Stephen would like to ensure that the ALA becomes a culturally safe organisation which has a governance framework that supports Indigenous Australians and respectfully engages with them to capture Traditional knowledge, including language.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m keen to ensure that data is appropriately managed in terms of Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property right, and that sovereignty of the data remains with the Knowledge holder,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am also keen to ensure that language is captured as part of Traditional Knowledge, as language is inherently linked to culture, and Country for Indigenous Australians.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did you know?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When not working Stephen enjoys botanising, fishing, pottering around the house and in his workshop and keeping abreast of Australian ecological literature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen attended Christian Brother Colleague in Perth for his high school education.&nbsp; He was a reasonable cross country and mid-distant runner and sprinter.&nbsp; His finishing time for the 400m sprint at the Inter-school Catholic Colleges sports carnival set in 1985 still stands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div

In particular, providing access to the first descriptions of species greatly benefits the taxonomic community as all descriptions of new or revised species must be referenced to species concepts that have been put forward before. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assigning DOIs (digital object identifiers) is an important component of BHL Australia\u2019s work. DOIs make the historic literature discoverable; they provide a unique and permanent link to each scientific description online, enabling authors, publishers, and taxonomic databases (such as the ALA) to persistently link to (and find) that literature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historic literature is critical to our understanding of Australia\u2019s biodiversity, particularly our understanding of changes in species distribution and  abundance. Since 2010, BHL Australia, and our evergrowing number of Australian contributors, have made almost 400,000 pages of Australia\u2019s biodiversity literature openly accessible online. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You can access BHL Australia at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biodiversitylibrary.org\/collection\/bhlau\">www.biodiversitylibrary.org\/collection\/bhlau <\/a>or via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bhl_au\">Twitter @bhl_au<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bhl_au?lang=en\"> <\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/21280-ALA-Case-Study-Fact-Sheets-\u2013-Biodiversity-Heritage-Library-V3-lowres.pdf\">View or print this impact story as a PDF<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BHL Australia is a national project working to digitise Australia\u2019s biodiversity heritage literature and make it freely accessible online.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44689,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[170,11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44687"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44687"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44687\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44719,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44687\/revisions\/44719"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44689"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44687"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44687"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44687"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":44677,"date":"2021-05-19T14:57:25","date_gmt":"2021-05-19T04:57:25","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=44677"},"modified":"2021-05-19T15:00:22","modified_gmt":"2021-05-19T05:00:22","slug":"international-living-atlases-australian-software-used-across-the-globe","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/international-living-atlases-australian-software-used-across-the-globe\/","title":{"rendered":"International Living Atlases: Australian software used across the globe"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/21280-ALA-Case-Study-Fact-Sheet-International-Living-Atlases-V3-004.pdf\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Living-Atlases-case-study-thumbnail-727x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44678\" width=\"306\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Living-Atlases-case-study-thumbnail-727x1024.png 727w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Living-Atlases-case-study-thumbnail-213x300.png 213w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Living-Atlases-case-study-thumbnail-768x1082.png 768w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Living-Atlases-case-study-thumbnail-1090x1536.png 1090w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Living-Atlases-case-study-thumbnail.png 1349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" \/><\/a><figcaption>View or print this impact story as a PDF<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) was established by the Australian Government\u2019s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) to provide researchers, decision makers and community groups a one-stop-shop for biodiversity data. There are now over 20 international Living Atlases based on the software platform originally developed by the ALA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-ala-goes-global\">The ALA goes global<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Within a few years of operation, the ALA rapidly established 100s of data partners across museums and herbaria, universities, government departments and community groups in Australia. Soon Australia\u2019s biodiversity data were accessible online for ecoscience research, state and federal government environment and species conservation management programs. As the Australian node of GBIF \u2013 the Global Biodiversity Information Facility \u2013 the ALA supported the international community by sharing expertise and open software code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, the ALA hosted the first international Living Atlases community meeting to respond to requests from countries around the world. This helped form the collaborative global community that now supports developers implementing the open source platform. The software code has been used to set up 27 installations around the world for national biodiversity databases as well as thematic, regional and institutional instances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-international-living-atlases-community\">The international Living Atlases community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Living Atlases platform enables countries to aggregate biodiversity data from multiple sources and supports integrated access to other biological and environmental information such as temperature, habitat etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Living Atlas community members continue to work collaboratively to share code and learn from experiences in establishing national biodiversity databases in their countries. They have organised technical training sessions and presented at numerous international meetings. As a result of these and other efforts, an increasing number of GBIF nodes and other organisations have implemented the platform. The Living Atlases community website offers full technical documentation, news from across the community and a current and complete list of participating countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/living-atlases.gbif.org\/\">Living Atlases website<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/21280-ALA-Case-Study-Fact-Sheet-International-Living-Atlases-V3-004.pdf\">View or print this impact story as a PDF<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Atlas of Living Australia is a world leader in biodiversity data infrastructure.

Early and ongoing investment from the Australian Government National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy was timely and has had a lasting impact on how biodiversity data are managed and accessed on a global scale.\u201d says ALA Director Dr Andre Zerger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cWe thought it was time to document this history and achievement and I believe this paper will become a critical reference for the international biodiversity data community.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking back \u2013 our origin story<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s set the scene \u2013 it\u2019s the late 1990s. You are a taxonomist&nbsp;trying to find specimen data for a research project. To find this information you must personally contact managers of collections, undertake formal loans of specimens from many museums, or travel across the country and internationally to get access to where specimens of interest have been recorded. After months of letters, emails and phone calls, you\u2019re finally able to analyse the data and start your research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a process that was kept on repeat for decades. Finding and accessing biodiversity data was a major challenge, it wasn\u2019t accessible or shared between organisations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the mid-2000s, the research community saw opportunity in emerging digital technologies and significant collaborative initiatives were underway to start to share data. Cue the review of national research infrastructure. The findings of this review led to the Australian Government accepting the &nbsp;proposal of the natural history collections community &nbsp;\u2013 to build on the collaboration already well advanced to create a single online platform that would harmonises all existing databases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2006, 25 representatives from across biological collections met at the Australian Museum in Sydney. Here, the group identified the significant benefits of an aggregated database and the Atlas of Living Australia was formed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here we are now \u2013 Australia\u2019s national biodiversity database<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flash forward to the present day, we now successfully aggregate and harmonise biodiversity data from not only museum and herbarium collections, but &nbsp;government departments, research institutions, Indigenous knowledge holders, community groups, universities, and individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, we celebrated our 10 years of making biodiversity information accessible to all. Our celebrations were particularly focussed on thanking the founding partners and biodiversity data providers that helped us reach where we are today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 10 years since our launch, we have achieved many milestones and enabled impact across the globe. There are now more than 90 million occurrence records of 110,000 species, 5000 species lists, 2000 biodiversity-related projects, 500 environmental layers. We have also enabled a number of biodiversity data portals by making the underlying ALA code openly available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also taken a leadership role globally through the Living Atlases program. There are instances of ALA software delivering national biodiversity capabilities in 24 countries around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"903\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/10-stats-for-10-years_image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44393\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/10-stats-for-10-years_image.png 903w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/10-stats-for-10-years_image-300x213.png 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/11\/10-stats-for-10-years_image-768x544.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does the future hold?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following our Future Directions National Consultation process in 2019, we began to shift our focus to the new challenges ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The consultation process highlighted how far the ALA has come and the impact we have had on the way Australian biodiversity data are utilised. However, the consultation also highlighted some areas of improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To reach our full potential and continue delivering innovative data solutions, the ALA will have a future focus on projects that aim to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>increase data quality within the ALA<\/li><li>deliver a diverse range of data to support biodiversity reporting<\/li><li>harmonise industry data gathered through surveys with existing data available through museums, herbaria, and state data programmes<\/li><li>take a leadership role in facilitating cooperation and collaboration between institutions<\/li><li>integrate additional data streams, such as images, genomics, sounds recordings and environmental assessment data to paint a more extensive picture of Australian biodiversity.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have already embarked on several projects to transform the way people access biodiversity data through the ALA.
