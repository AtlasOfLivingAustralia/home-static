What&#8217;s your study background?<br><\/strong>I am an international student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Honours) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). I\u2019m in my final year and I have always had an interest in software and cloud technologies. Throughout my studies, I\u2019ve gained a solid foundation in programming, software and engineering, and I\u2019m really excited to apply my academic knowledge to practical environment and real-world projects.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. What was the topic you chose to focus on? What factors led you to choose this topic?<br><\/strong>I chose to focus on DevOps engineering, which involved migrating the ALA\u2019s Restricted Access Species Data system\u2019s deployment process. I chose this one because it involves continuous integration and continuous delivery and cloud technologies. My interest in cloud computing and automation, along with the opportunity to work on real-world problems related to my major, made this topic quite interesting for me. Although I\u2019m interested in other topics as well, this one suited me the best for my background.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. What\u2019s a new skill that you learned through the program?<br><\/strong>I gained valuable experience with cloud technologies, particularly in using infrastructure-as-code solutions that aligns with ALA\u2019s workflow and developed much deeper understanding of different use cases of cloud services and best practice of cloud native technology when building out the infrastructure.<br>I also learned a lot about DevOps and approaches to managing infrastructure. There\u2019s always a gap between learning it from documentation and then applying that to a project. I\u2019m also impressed how ALA manage all the infrastructure and services efficiently.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?<br><\/strong>One challenge I encountered was differences between two tools we used when migrating the deployment process of API. The existing tool Pulumi made things simple by letting me set up the API with just a few basic settings, but it is highly abstracted. When I switched to using our internal technologies, it provided a more detailed and fine-grained control\u2014I had to manually set up several pieces and make sure they all worked together. At one point, I missed a step, which led to a significant amount of time spent troubleshooting the issue. It was a real learning experience in paying attention to details and troubleshooting issues.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. What was the highlight of your internship experience?<br><\/strong>The highlight of my internship was successfully completing the system migration with minimal downtime. It was rewarding to see the deployment go smoothly, especially after the long preparation during this summer.<br>Working with my team at ALA was a fantastic experience. Everyone was incredibly supportive, and I learned so much from their expertise\u2014especially from my mentor, Joe. Their guidance helped me apply ALA\u2019s best practices while recreating the infrastructure, allowing us to fully automate the process when setting up and tearing down different environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\" class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\" id=\"jarod-wright-is-studying-a-bachelor-of-science-majoring-in-ecology-and-conservation-biology-at-the-university-of-wollongong\"><strong>Jarod Wright is studying a Bachelor of Science majoring in Ecology and Conservation Biology at the University of Wollongong.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"891\" height=\"751\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Jarod-Wright.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-50437\" style=\"width:404px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Jarod-Wright.jpg 891w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Jarod-Wright-300x253.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Jarod-Wright-768x647.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jarod Wright participated in the ALA\u2019s 2025 Summer Internship Program.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><strong>1. What\u2019s your study background?<br><\/strong>My background is a mix of computer science and science. I\u2019m currently studying a Bachelor of Science majoring in Ecology and Conservation Biology, with previous studies majoring in Computer Science.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. What was the topic you chose to focus on? What factors led you to choose this topic?<br><\/strong>I looked at the impact that the Black Summer bushfires had on Southern Greater Gliders (Petauroides volans) distribution. As a proud Wodi Wodi man, I am deeply interested in understanding how megafires like the Black Summer fires have impacted biodiversity and species distribution in Australia, especially so given the wide scale prevention of the community from continuing traditional fire regimes on the east coast of Australia since colonisation.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. What\u2019s a new skill that that you learned through the program?<br><\/strong>Species distribution modelling is the biggest skill I learnt! It was a lot of fun and really eye opening to learn about, being able to go out and find data to analyse, and then to produce a species distribution map was a very enjoyable experience and it was very rewarding to produce that final output.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?<br><\/strong>Managing spatial data and pushing the limits of what my computer could handle was the biggest challenge. The spatial data I was working with is quite big, and modelling is computationally intensive, so it often took a while to run and crashes were frequent, which made debugging and producing the final result a very long but ultimately rewarding experience.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. What was the highlight of your internship experience?<br><\/strong>The highlight of my internship was definitely getting to know the Science and Decision Support team and working closely with them, whilst spending my summer developing my R skills on a topic that I am very passionate about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\" class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\" id=\"jeff-lu-is-studying-a-bachelor-of-information-systems-at-the-university-of-nsw\"><strong>Jeff Lu is studying a Bachelor of Information Systems at the University of NSW.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"796\" height=\"930\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Jeff-Lu.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-50436\" style=\"width:391px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Jeff-Lu.jpg 796w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Jeff-Lu-257x300.jpg 257w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/Jeff-Lu-768x897.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jeff Lu participated in the ALA\u2019s 2025 Summer Internship Program.

What was the topic you chose to focus on? What factors led you to choose this topic?<br><\/strong>The topic of focus involves gathering user requirements to redesign the user interface of ALA\u2019s Profile Collections site. I chose this topic because I have a keen interest in UX\/UI and business analysis, and this topic was perfect for me to apply these skills that I learned in university.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. What\u2019s a new skill that you learned through the program?<br><\/strong>A new skill that I earned through the program was interviewing people. Before this internship, I had never interviewed anyone before, so naturally, I wouldn\u2019t know how to structure an interview or how to ask questions effectively. Through the guidance of my supervisor and buddy in this project, I was able to learn the key techniques and methods of interviewing people, as well as what questions to ask in order to get the most insights out of people.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. What was the biggest challenge you encountered during the program?<br><\/strong>The biggest challenge I encountered during this internship was that I had to work remotely away from my supervisors. Personally, I enjoy collaborating face-to-face with people as it allows for more interactive discussions and immediate feedback.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. What was the highlight of your internship experience?<br><\/strong>The highlight of my internship would have to be meeting so many amazing people from within ALA. Even though most of us are based in different locations, I was still able to chat and have meaningful conversations with many of my colleagues. Additionally, my colleagues in the Sydney office have been super kind and welcoming to me since day one, which made my internship experience a whole lot better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\" class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\" id=\"more-information\"><strong>More information<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to know more, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/ala.org.au\/internships\/\">ALA internship opportunities<\/a> page, or contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@ala.org.au\">support@ala.org.au<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Supporting the next generation to gain hands-on experience in STEM fields is critical to engaging and inspiring our future researchers and data scientists.

Species specimens from museums or herbaria are invaluable sources for this task. The thing is, getting access to specimen data isn&#8217;t always easy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One challenge stems from a strength of taxonomy: It&#8217;s a global discipline. Natural history specimens are sent around the world to experts for careful description and classification. This means that specimens, including those of Australian species, can end up anywhere on the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another challenge is getting access to specimen data. Digitising specimens helps to make important specimens discoverable by end users. Museums and herbaria face a vast task in digitising their collections, and even though Australia is one of the leading countries in this respect, when there are only one or two existing specimens of a species in the world, it can be difficult to even find these amidst the ocean of specimens awaiting digitisation!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While progress continues to be made digitising the global backlog, it is important to also gather existing lesser-known datasets with <em>digitised <\/em>specimen data \u2013 digitally catalogued physical specimens, photographs or sounds (and metadata about the place and time they were recorded). People often don&#8217;t think to look in international digital specimen datasets for data on Australian species.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ALA is fortunate to partner with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gbif.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Global Biodiversity Information Facility<\/a> (GBIF), an international repository of many regional and national <a href=\"https:\/\/living-atlases.gbif.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Living Atlases<\/a> like the ALA. From GBIF, the ALA was able to source an additional three million records of Australian species to the ALA&#8217;s 150 million records.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These additional records have provided the first digital records of a whopping 7,914 Australian species. Another 6,177 had the number of records doubled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/gecko.jpg\" alt=\"close up of a gecko with large golden eyes, and mottled yellow and brown body\" class=\"wp-image-50405\" style=\"width:751px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/gecko.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/gecko-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2025\/03\/gecko-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Gulbaru Gecko (<em>Phyllurus gulbaru<\/em>), photo credit: dhfischer CC-BY<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is even more exciting for threatened species. These GBIF data have contributed more than 72,703 records of 1,393 federally threatened species! Crucially, GBIF data has contributed records for 482 data-poor species (species with less than 80 records).

The ALA hosted the event in partnership with the Queensland Museum, Phenomics Australia and CSIRO.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event focussed on the fundamental role research collections and biobanks play in supporting science, decision-making, and industry applications which has received renewed interest, given technological advances that can rapidly generate new data and insights from physical specimens. Novel techniques in genomics, advanced imaging, and, increasingly artificial intelligence and machine learning, means that more information than ever can be derived from Australia\u2019s research collections.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event brought together international and local experts from across the collections and biobanking sector to explore a number of areas that are seen as critical for supporting future science needs, including (a) Collection digitisation, storage and management, (b) Digital infrastructure, data access and integration, (c) Emerging transformational technology, (d) Skills and workforce development, and finally (e) Sectoral leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The importance of Indigenous data sovereignty and the opportunity to improve how a future state incorporates non-Western knowledge systems was also identified as fundamental.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With ALA\u2019s historic focus on partnering with Australia\u2019s biological collections sector, it was great to see the parallels within other domains such as human health biobanking and it\u2019s clear there is much to be gained for partnering further.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICRI congress itself was fantastic and inspiring to see the current \u2018state of the research infrastructure\u2019 internationally, across a number of domain areas. Several ICRI presentations remain available at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@ICRI2024\/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@ICRI2024\/videos<\/a> and I encourage you to view some of these as they so effectively highlight the strength of Australia\u2019s research infrastructure system, and future opportunities confronting our sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy reading our March 2025 Newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr Andre Zerger, ALA Director.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the March 2025 edition of our Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) newsletter.
