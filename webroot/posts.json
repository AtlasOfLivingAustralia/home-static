Indeed, the genesis of the ALA was built on the strength and richness of existing relationships within the museums, collections and herbaria communities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia\u2019s fruitful partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gbif.org\/\">GBIF<\/a>) also provides our community a unique opportunity to ensure that local, regional or national biodiversity data delivers impact globally. The ALA is particularly proud of the relationship we play hosting the Australian node of GBIF.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supported by the Australian Government\u2019s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.education.gov.au\/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris\">NCRIS<\/a>), and hosted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/\">CSIRO<\/a>, the ALA website launched 10 years ago. Since those beginnings the ALA has matured from an energetic \u2018start-up\u2019 to a stable and reliable data infrastructure delivering world-trusted biodiversity data and related services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our strategy builds on this history while identifying where we need to evolve. This includes adapting our infrastructure to deal with an increase in volume and variety of data, improving how we deal with data quality in a federated system, delivering more comprehensive and representative national data holdings, and partnering with new sectors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We welcome&nbsp;further conversations with our partners to identify&nbsp;possible alignment opportunities framed around our strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@ala.org.au\">support@ala.org.au<\/a> if you would like more information or if you have any questions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we release our Atlas of Living Australia Strategy 2020-2025.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":33,"featured_media":44124,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11,12],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44114"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/33"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44114"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44114\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44123,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44114\/revisions\/44123"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44124"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44114"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44114"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44114"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":44139,"date":"2020-07-07T09:49:44","date_gmt":"2020-07-06T23:49:44","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=44139"},"modified":"2020-07-07T10:03:50","modified_gmt":"2020-07-07T00:03:50","slug":"message-from-andre-zerger-atlas-of-living-australia-director-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/message-from-andre-zerger-atlas-of-living-australia-director-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Message from Andre Zerger, Atlas of Living Australia Director"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Dear ALA community,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44152\" width=\"162\" height=\"162\" srcset=\"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2.png 300w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Andre-Zerger-portrait-2019-1-300x300-2-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We lead off this issue with the release of the ALA Strategy 2020-2025 which has been developed in response to the findings from our 2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/ala-future-directions-national-consultation-findings-report\/\">ALA Future Directions<\/a> national consultation process. Our communities\u2019 feedback regarding what\u2019s worked well and where the ALA needs to head to continue to remain relevant was instrumental in shaping the strategy and we are grateful for those contributions. Our strategy has also been informed by what our team understands needs to evolve to future-proof the ALA, for example with regard to the anticipated increase in the variety and volume of data we receive annually from our partners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to our strategy we\u2019ve already commenced both an architectural upgrade to our infrastructure, and the ALA data quality project both of which are described in further detail on our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/current-projects\/\">projects pages<\/a>. These projects go to the core of our first two strategic objectives around delivering <em>trusted data<\/em> and provision of <em>robust services<\/em>. In addition to steering the ALA&#8217;s work program we see the strategy as an opportunity for our partners to identify points of engagement or alignment, and in coming months we\u2019ll provide you greater clarity around our project roadmap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the summer bushfire crisis, ALA on behalf of CSIRO led a national coordination process bringing together the citizen science and research sectors to explore how best to support ongoing response and preparedness activities.&nbsp; This activity resulted in the publication of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csiro.au\/en\/Research\/Environment\/Extreme-Events\/Bushfire\/Citizen-Science\/Citizen-Science-Bushfire-Forums\">recommendations report<\/a> which explores how to establish a national approach for ongoing citizen science and traditional science engagement. CSIRO have now appointed a program lead to further progress this work. Erin Roger, based with the ALA, will design and lead a program of work to engender greater coordination between both sectors with the aim of&nbsp; better supporting current recovery, and future preparedness activities as we approach the coming summer. We are pleased to be working so closely with CSIRO\u2019s bushfire and recovery program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, in this issue we showcase three contemporary Australian research publications that leverage the capability of the ALA to further our understanding of climate impacts on eucalypts and coral, the long-term shifts in the distribution of plant species that provide critical habitat for Koalas, and evaluating low-cost techniques for monitoring pollinators in open and wooded habitats. For our data partners and our team its always rewarding to see how our collective efforts enable such important science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy the winter edition of our newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind regards,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andre Zerger<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the winter edition of our ALA newsletter. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1456,"featured_media":44151,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11,12],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44139"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1456"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=44139"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44139\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":44153,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/44139\/revisions\/44153"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/44151"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=44139"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=44139"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=44139"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":44142,"date":"2020-07-07T09:49:26","date_gmt":"2020-07-06T23:49:26","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/?p=44142"},"modified":"2020-09-10T11:17:13","modified_gmt":"2020-09-10T01:17:13","slug":"refreshing-our-spatial-services","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/blogs-news\/refreshing-our-spatial-services\/","title":{"rendered":"Refreshing our spatial services"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"305\" height=\"259\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1.png 305w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Spatial-Portal-layer-review-1-300x255.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"spatial-information-in-the-ala\"><strong>Spatial information in the ALA<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/regions.ala.org.au\/\">https:\/\/regions.ala.org.au\/https:\/\/regions.ala.org.au\/<\/a>Spatial information is a big part of what we do at the ALA.

It\u2019s critically endangered with a population estimated at 300-500 individuals. This estimate was before the 2019-20 bushfires.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 90 per cent of the dunnarts\u2019 habitat was burnt in the bushfires. Therefore there\u2019s been a significant decline in the population. This means it\u2019s more important than ever to track and protect these animals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, we launched the virtual expeditions and Kangaroo Island Dunnart Survey project as part of our Citizen Science Bushfire Project. And with great success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteers from across Australia joined the expeditions. They reviewed a series of images and a list of possible animals to look out for. Keen-eyes worked out what species were in the images. And once submitted, the team sent the next set of images. Addictive, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within three weeks of launching, the volunteers identified and classified 15,000 images for the dunnart survey. The team were overwhelmed with eager people asking when there would be more images to transcribe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44093\" width=\"911\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart.jpg 768w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/camera-trap-image-KI-dunnart-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 911px) 100vw, 911px\" \/><figcaption>Volunteers identified the species found in images like this one taken by motion sensing cameras.

Corals have suffered mortalities from moderate to severe&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gbrmpa.gov.au\/news-room\/latest-news\/latest-news\/coral-bleaching\/2020\/statement-coral-bleaching-on-the-great-barrier-reef\">coral bleaching<\/a>&nbsp;associated with unusually high seawater temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBy comparing research efforts, eucalypt and reef coral workers might benefit from each other\u2019s experiences,\u201d Muir said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cResearchers are putting huge efforts into understanding these threats, likely future changes and how we can manage these systems to prevent species extinctions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example where knowledge could be usefully shared is in the prediction of changes to species distributions that will occur from climate change impacts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-are-a-plant-and-animal-species-going-to-help-each-other-to-fight-climate-change\">How are a plant and animal species going to help each other to fight climate change?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CSIRO researchers made pioneering advances in developing species distribution modelling or&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/csiropedia.csiro.au\/bioclim\/\">SDM<\/a>, which determines how environmental factors such as mean annual temperature and rainfall of the driest quarter shape a species distribution. More recently, eucalypt researchers from various agencies have predicted likely future changes in species distribution under various climate change scenarios. These results are critical for managing ecosystems, for example by identifying particularly vulnerable species and tailoring management responses to prevent species declines. Researchers have spent many years working collaboratively with other colleagues and institutions developing the large datasets of species distributions and environmental conditions that are required for SDM analyses. In contrast, SDM analyses have only rarely been used in coral research but could provide important information for managing the future of reefs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am hoping the work we have done with eucalypts can help coral researchers benefit from these methods and avoid some of the traps,\u201d Booth said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four key areas of research Booth and Muir considered in the journal article were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(1) modelling current distributions,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(2) assessing impacts of climate change on future distributions,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(3) using human-assisted migration to improve survival and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(4) applying genetic enhancement to improve species\u2019 survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With many years of examining the climatic tolerances of eucalypts, it is not surprising that experience from eucalypt studies may have more to offer climate change studies of corals than vice versa. However coral studies are successfully and rapidly applying novel spatial, controlled environment and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.csiro.au\/heat-resistant-coral\/\">genomic methods<\/a>&nbsp;to assess how coral species may adapt to changing climatic conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"drawing-on-existing-data-bases\">Drawing on existing data bases<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/The-beautiful-Wheeler-Reef-in-2012.-The-reef-is-situated-in-the-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-44075\" width=\"440\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/The-beautiful-Wheeler-Reef-in-2012.-The-reef-is-situated-in-the-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/The-beautiful-Wheeler-Reef-in-2012.-The-reef-is-situated-in-the-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/The-beautiful-Wheeler-Reef-in-2012.-The-reef-is-situated-in-the-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/The-beautiful-Wheeler-Reef-in-2012.-The-reef-is-situated-in-the-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/The-beautiful-Wheeler-Reef-in-2012.-The-reef-is-situated-in-the-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/The-beautiful-Wheeler-Reef-in-2012.-The-reef-is-situated-in-the-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir-1920x1440.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/edit-test.ala.org.au\/app\/uploads\/2020\/06\/The-beautiful-Wheeler-Reef-in-2012.-The-reef-is-situated-in-the-central-GBR-off-Townsville.-Image-by-Paul-Muir-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" \/><figcaption>The beautiful Wheeler Reef in 2012.
